BRIEF

>METHODS  
>  
>Model Structure Using Microsoft Excel, version 16, with the Crystal Ball add-in, the team developed a computational transmission, clinical, and economics outcomes model (in 2020) representing the U.S. population (357,157,434 people) and their different interactions with each other as well as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential health and economic outcomes. Th**e model (Appendix Figure 1) advances in discrete, 1-day time steps for 2.5 years (which is the longest epidemic duration in the scenarios evaluated in this study). On any given day, each individual in the model is in 1 of 5 mutually exclusive SARS-CoV-2 states: (1) susceptible (S, not infected and able to become infected), (2) exposed (E, infected, but not able to transmit to others), (3) infectious and asymptomatic (Ia, infected, but without symptoms, and able to transmit to others), (4) infectious and symptomatic (Is, infected, showing symptoms, and able to transmit to others), or (5) recovered/immune (R, not infected and unable to become infected).** On Day 1, a set number of individuals start in the Ia state and Is state (i.e., coronavirus seed), with the remainder starting in the S state. Each day, individuals interact with each other, and a person that is infectious can potentially transmit the virus to a person who is susceptible. If a susceptible person comes in contact with an infectious person and is exposed, they move from the S state to the E state. The following equation determines the number of susceptible individuals who became exposed each day: β × S × Is + (β × 0.5) × S × Ia. Beta (β) equals the basic reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated by 1 infectious case) divided by the infectious period duration and the number of individuals in the population, S and I represent the number of susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, on any given day. Exposed individuals remain in the E state for the latent period duration (i.e., time between exposure and ability to transmit) before becoming infectious and moving to the I state (at a rate of 1/latent period duration). As individuals can transmit the virus prior to disease onset, 8 they could transmit 1 day prior to the start of symptoms. Each individual moving to the I state has a probability of being symptomatic, which governs if they are in the Is or Ia state. Each person in the model draws an infectious period duration from a distribution (range=4–15 days, including the day prior to symptom onset). Infectious individuals remain in the I state until they recover and are no longer infectious, moving from the I state to the R state (at the rate of 1/infectious period duration).

>RESULTS   
>  
>**No Vaccine**   
>  
>Table 1 presents the results of the initial scenario (i.e., no vaccination), showing the number of cases, clinical outcomes, resources used, and costs incurred over the epidemic duration. When R0 is 2.5, an epidemic results in 282.5 million total SARS-CoV-2 cases, and a higher R0 of 3.5 results in 312.9 million total cases.    
>  
>**Vaccine Efficacy Needed to Prevent an Epidemic**   
>  
>These scenarios determine what would happen if vaccination took place at the very early stage of the epidemic or prior to a second or subsequent wave. The question then is whether vaccination can prevent a peak from occurring. Figure 1 shows how vaccine efficacy (x-axis) and coverage (those vaccinated and those otherwise immune) can reduce the size of the peak (i.e., maximum number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections; y-axis), in terms of percentage reduction of what the peak would be without vaccination. **As Figure 1A shows, vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% (when it prevents infection) to reduce the peak by >99% (i.e., number of new cases per day never exceeds the initial number of cases on Day 1) when R0 is 2.5 and vaccination coverage is 100%. This vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60%. When coverage drops to 50%, it is no longer possible to eliminate the peak, even when vaccine efficacy is 100%. Of course, eliminating the peak does not necessarily mean there will be no cases as infection can continue to occur at a stable level. Figure 2 shows how the vaccine efficacy (x-axis) impacts the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases averted (yaxis) compared with no vaccination over the simulated period.**   
>  
>**Vaccine Efficacy Needed to Extinguish an Ongoing Epidemic**   
>  
>The next set of scenarios evaluated what would occur if vaccinating during the course of an epidemic and to what degree vaccination could extinguish the epidemic. This would correspond to rolling out a vaccine at various points during an epidemic. Again, Figures 1B–D and 2B–D show how vaccine efficacy and coverage can reduce the size of the peak and impact the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases averted compared with no vaccination when different percentages of the population have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (assuming that natural infection incurs immunity). Table 1 shows the clinical and economic outcomes. As shown in Figure 1B, when vaccination prevents infection and occurs after 5% of the population has already been exposed, the peak can only be reduced by, at the most, 86% when R0 is 2.5. Vaccine efficacy has  to be at least 60% to reduce the peak by 85% when coverage is 100%. This vaccine efficacy threshold increases to 80% when coverage drops to 75% (86% reduction) and 100% when coverage drops to 60% (85% reduction). However, while reducing the peak, the number of cases averted continues to increase, not reaching the maximum until both vaccine efficacy and coverage are 100% (Figure 2B). When vaccination occurs after 15% of the population has already been exposed, the resulting reduction in the peak is, at most, 65%. As Figure 1C shows, the reduction in the peak size plateaus after vaccine efficacy reaches and exceeds 60% with a 100% coverage and 80% with a 75% coverage. However, the number of cases averted continues to accrue with increases in efficacy, until reaching the maximum when both vaccine efficacy and coverage are 100% (Figure 2C).",9,0.047,0.041,0.913,-0.3925

> From what I gather, if we can achieve sterilizing immunity with a vaccine it's unlikely that the general public would need an annual or bi-annual SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

This is going to totally depend on the efficacy of the vaccines we get. It's very possible that the first batch of vaccines aren't a killshot by any means, and annual/bi-annual vaccines will be needed. We have to assume that COVID19 will become endemic like the other 4 coronavirus and repeat infections will be possible. 

Most healthy people shouldn't have any issue with a repeat infection, except if it happens to catch you in a rough time health-wise (recovering from surgery or you have the flu..), in those instances, I imagine COVID19 could still cause quite a bit of an issue. I could see a scenario where COVID19 can still kill 100k/year+ just because it catches people who happen to have weakened immune systems during those time periods (and have been vaccinated in the past year). 

Because of that, I imagine the 2nd/3rd generation of the vaccine will likely be the one that kills COVID19 for good (and probably the other 4 coronavirus as well). COVID19 is just too deadly to allow it to circulate and become endemic.

fyov3or,2020-07-20,"**Background**

This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.

**Methods**

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 × 1010 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, [NCT04341389](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04341389).

**Findings**

603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles n=253; 5 × 1010 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 1011 viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 1010 viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented.

**Interpretation**

The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 × 1010 viral particles is safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.

>But (as I was going on about above), antibodies are not the whole story in the immune response to the coronavirus. Read those two posts linked on the subject if you haven’t, but the short form is that it appears that T-cell responses may be (1) longer-lasting, (2) important for some degree of protection against infection, and (3) perhaps already present (pre-COVID-19) in some fraction of the population due to exposure to as-yet-uncharacterized animal-derived coronavirus infections that we haven’t even noticed over the years. Moderna characterized their T-cell responses, and saw mostly CD4+ (as opposed to CD8+), and in those, mostly a Th1 response (see that earlier post for more on that). In this case, BNT162b1 produced CD4+ responses in 34 of 36 patients (one of these did have low levels of pre-existing reactive CD4+ cells, by the way – a lower percentage of people than found in the recent Nature paper, but it does confirm that such people are out there). The CD4+ responses correlated with the antibody titers raised in individual patients. And as with the Moderna results, these seemed to be almost entirely Th1 instead of Th2 – the authors believe that this is potentially a good thing, but as noted in the Moderna post, you can find arguments both ways about that point.
But as opposed to the Moderna candidate, there was also a robust CD8+ T-cell response (29/36 patients), which did not necessarily correlate with the antibody titers raised by the vaccine. Interestingly, neither of these T-cell effects were very dose-responsive. 6 out of 8 patients tested in the 1 µg dose cohort raised a T-cell response, and their CD4+ and CD8+ levels were almost the same as the 50 µg group! As a per cent of total circulating T cells, the levels seen after vaccination were significantly higher than those seen in the blood of convalescent patients, which could be a real difference. Recall that in the case of the 2003 SARS coronavirus, that antibodies disappeared from recovered patients, but that T-cell immunity has persisted for up to 17 years.
So while one would want to keep an eye on the antibody levels with this candidate (and believe me, you can be sure that Pfizer and BioNTech are doing that), the T cell response looks promising (and probably better than the Moderna candidate). We’ll have to keep all this in mind as the actual Phase II/III data hit, and we’ll see what difference all this makes in the real world!

BRIEF

>Within 14 days after the vaccination, 183 (72%) of 253 participants in the 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose group, and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 5×10¹⁰ viral particles dose group reported at least one solicited adverse reaction, both of which were significantly higher than the 46 (37%) of 126 participants in the placebo group (p<0·0001; table 2). The most common systemic solicited reactions in the 5×10¹⁰ and 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose groups were fatigue, reported by 42% and 34%; fever, reported by 32% and 16%; and headache, reported by 29% and 28%, respectively. The most common injection site solicited reaction was pain, reported by 57% of the 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose group and 56% of the 5×10¹⁰ viral particles dose group. Although most adverse reactions were reported as either mild or moderate, 24 (9%) of 253 participants receiving the vaccine at 1×10¹¹ viral particles had severe (grade 3) adverse reactions, which was significantly higher than those receiving the vaccine at 5×10¹⁰ viral particles (p=0·0011) or placebo (p=0·0004). The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse reactions was fever, in 20 (8%) of 253 participants in the 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose group, and one (1%) of 129 participants in the 5×10¹⁰ viral particles dose group. High pre-existing Ad5 immunity, increasing age, and male sex were associated with significantly lower occurrence of fever post vaccination (appendix p 13). The grade 3 reactions were self-limited and resolved within 72–96 h without medication (appendix pp 14–15). The unsolicited adverse reactions within 14 days post vaccination were reported by 19 (8%) participants in the 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose group, seven (5%) in the 5×10¹⁰ viral particles dose group, and seven (6%) in the placebo group, showing no difference across the groups. Overall, 196 (77%) participants in the 1×10¹¹ viral particles dose group, 98 (76%) in the 5×10¹⁰ viral particles dose group, and 61 (48%) in the placebo group experienced at least one or more adverse event within 28 days after the vaccination. No serious adverse events were documented within 28 days.  
>  
>We initiated this phase 2 trial before the full analysis of the data from the phase 1 study was available. The vaccine doses chosen were mainly based on the safety data from the dose-escalating phase 1 trial: a higher proportion of participants reported grade 3 adverse reactions in the high-dose group (1·5×10¹¹ viral particles) compared with low-dose (5×10¹⁰ viral particles) or middle-dose (1×10¹¹ viral particles) groups (17% vs 6% and 6%, respectively).9 Therefore, we assumed that the vaccine doses at 1×10¹¹ and 5×10¹⁰ viral particles might have similar safety profiles. In addition, an increasing antigen dose is often associated with increasing immunogenicity; thus, we expected the vaccine dose at 1×10¹¹ viral particles to be the better of the two doses. Therefore, we designed the randomisation of this study in a ratio of 2:1:1 for the dose groups of 1×10¹¹ and 5×10¹⁰ viral particles, and placebo group, respectively, giving more weight to the first group. We found, in contrast to our expectations, that the vaccine at 5×10¹⁰ viral particles had a better safety profile than, and comparable immunogenicity to, the vaccine at 1×10¹¹ viral particles. Age and pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity of the participants could have affected the candidate vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity.  We noted that the occurrence of fever was associated with decreasing age and low pre-existing immunity to the vaccine vector Ad5 virus. **19 (90%) of the 21 participants who experienced grade 3 fever had no pre-existing immunity to Ad5, with a neutralising antibody titre below detection. Increasing age and high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity were found to be able to significantly reduce the immune responses to the vaccine. In some participants with high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, one injection of the vaccine might be inadequate to induce a high level of humoral immune responses, particularly for people aged 55 years or older.**  
>  
>Our trial has some limitations. **First, this phase 2 trial started before the full analysis of the data from the phase 1 study was available, so we did not calculate the sample size based on study power in advance, which might lead to a lack of power to show the difference between dose groups. Second, the participants included in this study are all from Wuhan, China. The baseline anti-Ad5 immunity of the participants seemed to be representative of Chinese adults, according to the previously reported studies;18 however, anti-Ad5 immunity in adults varies from place to place globally, with reported proportions of adults with neutralising antibodies titres for Ad5 of more than 1:200 of about 80% in India, 78% in Kenya, 67% in Thailand, 64% in Uganda, around 60% in South Africa, 45% in Sierra Leone, and less than 30% in the USA.19–21 We might expect the candidate Ad5-vectored vaccine to have a superior immunogenicity in the population with a lower pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, but an inferior immunogenicity in people with a higher pre-existing antiAd5 immunity than observed in this phase 2 trial.**  

NOTES

\- It appears this vaccine is designed for use primarily in China. Prevalence of Ad5 seropositive worldwide will make its widespread use very problematic due to increase immune focus on the adenovirus than SARS-COV-2. 

\- This study had >55 old in their Phase 2 trial. However, older ppl showed lower antibody responses, particularly in terms of neutralizing Abs.

\- Adverse effects seems to be higher for this vaccine than the Oxford one.

\- Not everyone produced neutralizing antibodies after receiving the vaccine, only 97% in the  5 × 10¹⁰  viral  particles  dose.

Summary

Background

The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

We  did  a  phase  1/2,  single-blind,  randomised  controlled  trial  in  five  trial  sites  in  the  UK  of  a  chimpanzee  adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate  vaccine  (MenACWY)  as  control.  Healthy  adults  aged  18–55  years  with  no  history  of  laboratory  confirmed  SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5 ×  10¹⁰ viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded  ChAdOx1  nCoV-19  prime-boost  group  received  a  two-dose  schedule,  with  the  booster  vaccine  administered  28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total  IgG  ELISA  against  trimeric  SARS-CoV-2  spike  protein,  a  muliplexed  immunoassay,  three  live  SARS-CoV-2  neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay \[PRNT50\]; a microneutralisation assay \[MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90\]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic  virologically  confirmed  COVID-19,  and  safety,  as  measured  by  the  occurrence  of  serious  adverse  events.  Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination.  Here,  we  report  the  preliminary  findings  on  safety,  reactogenicity,  and  cellular  and  humoral  immune  responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.

Findings

Between  April  23  and  May  21,  2020,  1077  participants  were  enrolled  and  assigned  to  receive  either  ChAdOx1  nCoV-19  (n=543)  or  MenACWY  (n=534),  ten  of  whom  were  enrolled  in  the  non-randomised  ChAdOx1  nCoV-19  prime-boost  group.  Local  and  systemic  reactions  were  more  common  in  the  ChAdOx1  nCoV-19  group  and  many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group,  spike-specific  T-cell  responses  peaked  on  day  14  (median  856  spot-forming  cells  per  million  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells,  IQR  493–1802;  n=43).  Anti-spike  IgG  responses  rose  by  day  28  (median  157  ELISA  units  \[EU\],  96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R²=0·67 by Marburg VN; p<0·001).

Background 

This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.


Methods 

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 × 1010 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389.


Findings 

603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1×1011 viral particles n=253; 5×1010 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1×1011 and 5×1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1×1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1×1011 and 5×1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively.

We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee
adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18–55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5×10¹⁰ viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo
interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination.

Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1

many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493–1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10).

* Roughly 67% of vaccine candidates which go into human clinical trials ""pass"" phase I and start phase II. This ChAdOx-1 vaccine ""passed"" phase I and part of phase II. Most vaccine candidates don't enter human clinical trials and are not included in this data.

* About 50% of vaccine candidates which pass phase I eventually get approved after further trials. Since this also passed part of phase II you might assume the chances are a bit better, but this is also a more ""preliminary"" report, so 50% is probably a good guess.

* For Phase I and early Phase II tests, excluding high risk subjects is so common as to be essentially universal (at least in vaccine development; cancer drugs are different). The point of Phase I is to look for obvious problems, so they are always given to young and healthy volunteers. If any problems arise, they are more likely to survive. Phase III and usually later Phase II include larger, more diverse groups meant to represent the people the vaccine will eventually be approved for.

fyouzuh,2020-07-20,"The low neutralizing titers resultant from the initial dose may actually be the desired outcome. 

Mediation of the antibody response is involved in the methodology by which the vaccine approach 'trains' the T cell response. Early introduction of antibodies can disrupt the specific immune context involved in provoking the desired response by affecting phenotype selection, protein expression, antigen presentation etc., and there's some evidence that the context of those factors contributes directly to immunopathology associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19.

[A proteomic analysis](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30627-9.pdf) published recently in Cell identified that differential genetic expression causes anti-inflammatory macrophages to instead induce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to inflammatory cascade; the researchers, in line with mechanisms proposed by other researchers and [studied in SARS immunology](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/15160), observed that improper binding to the complement system of IgG produced by patients with severe disease was the primary contributing factor to that change in protein expression - in short, that high, early levels of IgG in certain circumstances affect changes to the immune system which cause the cytokine storm, similar to the immunopathology that causes FEC to become FIP. There's corresponding evidence that similar circumstances contribute to endothelial permeabilization associated with blood clotting dysfunction.

Another example: [in FIP](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jfms.2008.09.008?casa_token=6Be-F8tRKO4AAAAA:J9un_nu2DuHwVc339p-v0u3g78my6bZ1kZih6dblVw3DBgOaxJUwKQgrn3CJOQ2RMLFg_fcUpMUTB8I), the difference in early immune response has a noted effect on pathology. If the cellular response develops early, T cells receive signals which increase their effectiveness and a more effective immune response occurs. If the humoral response develops early, the cellular response can fail to properly develop while antibodies simultaneously enhance the infection, resulting in severe pathology. There are many similarities and some key differences between COVID-19 and FIP, but we can look at the above model and see why it might actually be preferable for a vaccine to promote a relatively weak initial antibody response while the body's newly produced T cells adapt to better neutralize the pathogen. 

Other antibody-mediated immunological consequences which can affect the function of the cellular immune response are quite common; a vaccine might avoid certain aspects of such antibody mediation in order to produce a highly effective immune response.

>To navigate the difficult ethical terrain of using placebo controls in vaccine trials, it is helpful to identify the conditions under which placebo use is clearly acceptable and clearly unacceptable. The following considerations assume that placebo interventions (e.g. subcutaneous injections of saline solution) themselves pose negligible risks.

>Placebo use in vaccine trials is clearly acceptable when (a) no efficacious and safe vaccine exists and (b) the vaccine under consideration is intended to benefit the population in which the vaccine is to be tested. In this situation, a placebo-controlled trial addresses the locally relevant question regarding the extent to which the new vaccine is better than nothing, and participants in the placebo arm of the trial are not deprived of the clinical benefits of an existing efficacious vaccine.

>Placebo use in vaccine trials is clearly unacceptable when (a) a highly efficacious and safe vaccine exists and is currently accessible in the public health system of the country in which the trial is planned and (b) the risks to participants of delaying or foregoing the available vaccine cannot be adequately minimized or mitigated (e.g. by providing counselling and education on behavioural disease prevention strategies, or ensuring adequate treatment for the condition under study to prevent serious harm).

One of the problems with a viral vector vaccine like ChAdOx is you run the risk of the body reacting to the Adenovirus “truck” instead of the SARS-COV-2 “payload”. This can happen if you use a “truck” virus that people already have immunity to (which would make the vaccine fail in those people), or if the immune system in some people reacts to the “truck” and makes antibodies to the “truck” instead of the “payload”, again failing to grant those people immunity.

With an mRNA vaccine, there isn’t really anything for the immune system to react to that wouldn’t grant immunity against the target virus (all “payload”, no “truck”), so you sidestep that problem. mRNA vaccines can also be scaled up to whatever production quantities you want really quickly. 

The biggest problem with mRNA vaccines is that we’ve never actually made one before, so we had no idea if this would even work. We’ve had plenty of experience with Adenovirus vectored stuff before, so that was the safer route. The good news is that if it does work, tailoring an mRNA vaccine to a different sequence in the future would be trivially easy. The next epidemic could be solved in weeks.

fypet3k,2020-07-20,"Oh. Well, at first glance, that's quite frankly not a good sign - lymphopenia and upregulated CRP are associated with macrophage recruitment into cytokine production and are established biomarkers for severe pathology in COVID-19. The higher doses may be too high or may have dynamics which promote enhancement of pro-inflammatory immunoregulatory pathways, because a CRP spike is primarily associated with severe (not even moderate) pathology.

I'll dive into it here in just a bit and get back to you.

u/MineToDine, yeah, my reading is that the upper-end doses are probably too high (maybe because they're trying to jack up that neutralizing response) - you can see that they didn't boost the 50ug dose likely for this reason.

The cytokine responses they're seeing are quite high, lining up with the enhanced cytokine induction identified in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140v1) when lung macrophages are exposed to both viral stimuli and anti-Spike IgG immune complexes which I found a bit surprising. However it looks like inflammation might successfully be offset by the increase in regulatory interleukins, in which case the cytokine levels could be helpful rather than harmful and results there might indicate appropriate balancing of immune activation and suppression of inflammation.

The upregulated CRP with lymphopenia occurs and bounces back prior to interaction with IgG, but those initial seven days look more similar to what's seen in severe than in mild patients - which, again, could be good for resulting immunity if associated damage is controlled and inflammatory cascade avoided. To that end, typically upregulated CRP with lymphopenia is associated with severe infection, but you'd expect slightly higher level of interleukins while the CRP/lymphopenia trend continued whereas the rebound here likely signals an appropriate adaptive response that would prevent inflammatory cascade.

To actually answer your question, though, I have no idea why the 1ug results would not follow the dose curve. Ha! Sorry! The high T cell production is definitely interesting, but they must have had some reason not to include 1ug results in the rest of the findings (since obviously Pfizer stands to make a lot of money off a vaccine which requires such an unbelievably tiny dose to induce effect).",4,0.08,0.068,0.852,0.2028

An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 COVID-19 vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 μg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 convalescent human serum panel (HCS). Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 μg) to 3.5-fold (50 μg) those of HCS. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had TH1 skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon (IFN)γ was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.

Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, this virus
has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a
vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus
(NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion
membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated
chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high
levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these
COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no
detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.",8,0.044,0.032,0.923,0.1779

>As a vaccine vector, NDV can accommodate foreign sequences with a good degree of stability and as a RNA virus, there is limited possibility for recombination with host cell DNA. Using NDV as a vaccine vector in humans offers several advantages over other viral vaccine vectors. NDV is safe in humans due to host range restriction and there is no pre-existing antibody to NDV in the human population. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens. NDV replicates to high titer in a cell line acceptable for human vaccine development. Therefore, NDV is an attractive vaccine vector for human pathogens for which vaccines are currently not available.

If we hold steady at ~60,000 infected in the US per day (current Worldometers 7-day average is 67,612), that means about 1 person out of every 5,000 in the US is infected each day ^1.

So, if the trial sample is entirely random ^2, you would expect about 3 people from the 15,000-member control cohort to be infected each day, and assuming 80% vaccine efficacy, about 0.6 people from the 15,000-member vaccine cohort.  You also have to remember that the vaccine's effects aren't immediate, so for at least a couple of weeks, the vaccine cohort will probably be getting sick at the same rate as the control cohort. Also, since this is a two-dose trial, I would assume that full efficacy isn't reached until a couple of weeks after the second shot at T+28 days, so you could be talking about up to 6 weeks before the ""real"" data starts rolling in and you can start actually counting cases.

Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens.  
>  
>RESULTS  
>  
>The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-μg dose group and 3481 in the 100-μg dose group. **Vaccination induced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)–biased CD4 T-cell responses and low or undetectable Th2 or CD8 T-cell responses. Viral replication was not detectable in BAL fluid by day 2 after challenge in seven of eight animals in both vaccinated groups. No viral replication was detectable in the nose of any of the eight animals in the 100-μg dose group by day 2 after challenge, and limited inflammation or detectable viral genome or antigen was noted in lungs of animals in either vaccine group.**

>CONCLUSIONS  
>  
>Vaccination of nonhuman primates with mRNA-1273 induced robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, rapid protection in the upper and lower airways, and no pathologic changes in the lung.

Coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a  dramatic global impact on public health, social, and economic  infrastructures. Here, we assess immunogenicity and anamnestic  protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)-delivered  SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800.  INO-4800 is an ID-delivered  DNA vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials.  Vaccination  with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody  responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.   Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with  SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T  and B cell responses.  These responses were associated with lower viral  loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of virus.  These  studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral  and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely  important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.",11,0.066,0.023,0.911,0.7096

The first givaway problem is the neutralisation never reaching 100%, have a look at the figures (image G).

Then if we look at the nAB assay graphs, we see that the titers are rather low for a pseudoneutralisation assay (they're not log10 but log2 graphs). Pseudo assays should be showing much higher titers as seen in the data for the other candidates (case in point, have a look at J&J data published in Nature today, it's excellent no matter how you splice and dice it).

They didn't do a live virus neutralisation assay either, even though they did a live virus challenge. Bit of a missed opportunity there, no?

Lastly, if we look at the challenge data we can quite clearly see that none of the initial peak AB titers were as high as the post challenge titers once the monkeys seroconverted (an order or two of magnitude difference there). The biggest jump is the nAB titer.

This to my amateur eye looks like a sub-optimal dose situation. It's not enough to get the nAB response going in a reasonable fashion. The challenge then brings that up to the levels where we have seen some of the other candidate vaccines induce. 

The vaccine provides partial protection. The title I think is a bit overselling it. If they fix the dose problem then it should be a good candidate, the overall profile of the immune response looks good, it's just too little of it there.",2,0.116,0.048,0.836,0.9667

A safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be required to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1–8. For global deployment and pandemic control, a vaccine that requires only a single immunization would be optimal. Here we show the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a single dose of adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in nonhuman primates. Fifty-two rhesus macaques were immunized with Ad26 vectors encoding S variants or sham control and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes9,10. The optimal Ad26 vaccine induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and provided complete or near-complete protection in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titres correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection.

illness. **Animals in this study were challenged with a high dose of virus

expose mucosal surfaces will induce mucosal immunity, which may 
result in reduced nasal shedding and onward transmission. It should be

The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating in recent history. The bacillus Calmette−Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of COVID-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.

Abstract

A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; P = 8 × 10−7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.",1,0.043,0.075,0.882,-0.9359

g0husuv,2020-08-05,"Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 16,000,000 people and has caused the death of more than 650,000 individuals since December 2019. A safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. Many human viral vaccines are live attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the development of a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03-CA22 degree celsius/2020) by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37 degree celsius to 22 degree celsius in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans through nasal spray. Its single dose was observed to strongly induce the neutralising antibody (over 640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibody in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show loss of body weight, death, and the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys. Taken together, the cold-adapted live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed by us may contribute to saving of human lives from the threat of SARS-CoV-2.",26,0.078,0.086,0.836,-0.5782
g0jl80y,2020-08-05,"This is an interesting paper. The vaccine results are hard to argue against, the mock mice all died while the vaccinated ones all lived and the high dose group had no detectable virus anywhere. The nAB titers are quite spectacular, think the might be the highest from all the other mouse challenge papers and this one was using a wild type virus to boot.

Some key things apart from the vaccine that are interesting:

 \- the mouse model looks very good for this sort of research, less need for NHP studies early on and no messing around with pseudo viruses.

\- the genome sequence comparisons are very interesting. Only one deletion of an amino acid and relatively few changes in the nucleotide sequences. The deletion would be very important to know the effect of, also, I would be very interested to know what the change in ORF8 did in regards to MHC-I suppression.",16,0.104,0.085,0.811,0.5223
g0pjmjd,2020-08-05,"I am skeptical of this approach because it uses phenotypic selection rather than careful genetic manipulation.  The first vaccine produced in this manner was the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and it has an unfortunate tendency to revert to wild-type.  We have had good responses with phenotypic selection in our paramyxovirus (measles, mumps) and rubella/varicella vaccines, but those have more extensive genomic alteration.  For coronaviruses, they are prone to recombination as a consequence of their replicative mechanism that involves ""jumping polymerase"" production of subgenomic RNAs with the transcriptional regulatory sequence attached to each subgenomic fragment.  

I think that there are a number of more targeted approaches that can be used.  First of all, I think the TRS in the attenuated vaccine needs to be altered so as to prevent recombination.  Second, I think that targeted deletion or mutation of proteins such as NSP1, E, and several of the nonstructural ORFs (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b) is a more promising approach and these could be grown on cell lines that rescue the virus from its mutations while producing a replication-incompetent or at least replication-compromised clone.  

The problem here is *time*.  These approaches will take time to develop, much more than simply cloning the S gene into already-available vectors.  

But there is one thing in this study I really do appreciate: the nasal route.  The current vaccines in progress mostly succumb to what I call ""the orthodoxy of the needle,"" which is an assumption that any vaccine must be injected.  This is a respiratory virus and so by giving the vaccine by injection, it's as if a bank posted pictures of the expected robber all over the building and posted security guards at all entrances *except* the one he's most likely to use.",2,0.09,0.043,0.867,0.9321

However, after a while, your body gets really good at killing the Frankenstein virus. At that point it no longer bothers to adjust its approach and just uses the antibodies you already have. 

So if your body didn't target the spikey head and just made antibodies for the part that it was glued to, it will simply and easily kill the Frankenstein virus with those antibodies.

Here, we performed cryo-EM and site-specific glycan analysis of one of the leading subunit vaccine candidates from Novavax based on a full-length spike protein formulated in polysorbate 80 (PS 80) detergent. Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the spike immunogen with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to published spike ectodomain structures. Interestingly, we also observed novel interactions between the spike trimers allowing formation of higher order spike complexes. This study confirms the structural integrity of the full-length spike protein immunogen and provides a basis for interpreting immune responses to this multivalent nanoparticle immunogen.

But I couldn't guess what those long term issues may be. 

Long term issues from covid stem either from chronic immune distinction brought on by the virus or some kind of chronic hidden viral infection. The second is highly unlikely with traditional safe vaccine methods.  Maybe with mRNA we will find a risk of something going wrong and creating long term production of viral fragments that trigger bad immune responses in people. But I haven't heard such concerns raised.

It also seems unlikely that the vaccines would damage someone's immune function without some early signs of issues. People with issues from covid-19 that could end up being chronic appear to have issues in months not years.

I think the big long term risks they want to screen out in phase three are various forms viral enhancement.

Background NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. We present the Day 35 primary analysis of our trial of NVX-CoV2373 with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adults. Methods This is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial in 131 healthy adults. Trial vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. Primary outcomes were reactogenicity, safety labs, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, wild-type virus neutralizing antibody, and T-cell responses. Results Participants received NVX-CoV2373 with or without Matrix-M1 (n=106) or placebo (n=25). There were no serious adverse events. Reactogenicity was mainly mild in severity and of short duration (mean ≥ 2 days), with second vaccinations inducing greater local and systemic reactogenicity. The adjuvant significantly enhanced immune responses and was antigen dose-sparing, and the two-dose 5μg NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 vaccine induced mean anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that exceeded the mean responses in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients with clinically significant illnesses. The vaccine also induced antigen-specific T cells with a largely T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype. Conclusions NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses (IgG and neutralization) four-fold higher than the mean observed in COVID-19 convalescent serum from participants with clinical symptoms requiring medical care and induced CD4+ T-cell responses biased toward a Th1 phenotype.

The  current paradigm that subunit vaccines require adjuvants to optimally  activate innate immunity implies that increased vaccine reactogenicity  will invariably be linked to improved immunogenicity. Countering this  paradigm, nanoparticulate vaccines have been reported to act as delivery  systems for vaccine antigens and induce immunity without the need for  exogenous adjuvants or local inflammation; however, the mechanisms  underlying the immunogenicity of nanoparticle vaccines are incompletely  identified. Here, we show that antigens displayed on self-assembling  nanofiber scaffolds and delivered intranasally are presented by CD103+ and CD11b+  lung dendritic cells that up-regulate CD80 and migrate into the  draining lymph node (LN). This was accompanied by a nearly exclusive  priming and accumulation of antigen-specific TH17 cells  occurring independently in both LN and lung. Thus, self-assembling  peptide nanofiber vaccines may represent a novel, needle- and  adjuvant-free means of eliciting protective immunity against fungal and  bacterial infections at skin and mucosal barrier surfaces.",2,0.073,0.01,0.917,0.8316

**Background**

The top priority for the control of COVID-19 pandemic currently is the development of a vaccine. A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac).

**Methods**

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 μg/0.5 mL or 6 μg /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay. 

**Results**

CoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 μg dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules. 

**Conclusions**

Favorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.",7,0.114,0.072,0.813,0.8926

1. They tested the general safety of the vaccine with people. They just don't label it ""Phase 1"" or ""Phase 2""
2. Since the vaccine seems not lead to dramatical side effects that are happening immediately, they jump to a bigger group of persons to check how good the immune response is working. But instead calling it ""the quickest Phase 3 ever"", they are calling it ""we have an officical vaccine... now we see how good it works in public"".But instead of performing it in other countries like Brazil or India, they are doing this first bigger tests in their own country. Because if they are doing it within their own borders, they can label it how they want... But also avaoid  a few bureaucratic obstacles and formal preparations. And this is probably exactly the biggest difference, why they can now even perform even quicker than the others already doing. But in fact.. all the others (like Oxford) don't act much different than Russia..
3. At the same time they already prepare everything for big mass production in the background.

And what's also very significant on all of that is, that the Russian vaccine seems to be built up very similar to the candidate from Oxford. They are using an modified Adenovirus to provoke an immuneresponse against the Spike Protein (which is the ""modified part"").

**1998: "" The results of the investigations showed that RotaShield vaccine caused intussusception in some healthy infants younger than 12 months of age who normally would be at low risk for this condition. ""**

1998: "" However, this link has not been found in the large body of research that has been done since that time. ""

**1976: "" The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.  ""**

1955: **""** However, most studies looking at the relationship between SV40 and cancers are reassuring, finding no causal association between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and development of cancer. ""

So only 2 can be said to be concerning. And for 1976 one, I'd say EVEN if it happens with a covid-19 vaccine, it would be worth it. 1 in 100,000 is 0.001%. Globally the population is 8 billion.

g1auuze,2020-08-11,"You are missing two other points:

1. Russia never said it would immediately vaccinate all citizens immediately. They are doing it very controlled. As I stated, they are just labeling stuff differently... But in general they are doing the same. And by vaccinate medical people first, they have for sure very good statistics at the moment on many of these are getting sick atm and can compare numbers in one month. That's one of the best target groups to make statistical comparisons (but that's not all they are doing - I'm sure about that.. ).

2. The most important factor: Putin. You can like him, you can hate him. He can be totally meaningless to you (which is probably my case, since I'm not from Russia, so he doesn't really matter to me). But it's a fact that Putin is an extremely intelligent and strategic person. I don't want to be political here - But Putin is definitely no person who doesn't know where is own competences end (like some some others...) and where he can trust which experts. And Putin (or Russia in general) is definitely DEFINITELY no person how is extremely talkative to rest in the world... Especially not when he could ""blame"" himself. So if Putin goes that public, that is definitely something behind that. 
He's a rational strategist who really thinks about all his actions and potential consequences. He wouldn't have dropped that bomb (and even added that ""human emotional factor"" by bringing his daughter into the game) if chances would be low that this stuff does not work. This public announcement was very well planned and thought out. 
In the end: we all don't know how long russian scientists are working on projects against Corona Viruses. But don't - really DON'T underestimate scientists in Russia.. Science is a really important (and respected) topic there.
We just know, that they already worked on Projects when SARS and MERS was a thing and that they developed an Adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine.
Putin is the last president who would go into the public if he's not to 90% sure that this can work. And the other 10% are not a big risk like ""everyone who gets vaccined dies in an instant"".
He's no guy who shouts some weird statements out of pure emotionality.

So be sure that under the hood they tested a lot and still do. They just don't make everything they're doing public. There this whole situation gets political.. Either you (as country) are trusting them.. Or not.
After all: the best way to reduce noise in vaccine studies are Human Challenge trials. But they are often considered as ""unethical"" (which is totally wrong.. Because it's also unethical to give thousands of people a placebo in a Phase 3 study and tell them ""there's now a certain chance to be immune""). That's our problem atm: we are so much ""bond"" to our usual scientific methods, that nobody in the last months ever said ""let's sit together and think about some adaptions of our methods"".

There are innitiatives like ""One day sooner"" where thousands of people declared themselves to be part of a Human Challenge trial.. But instead of initializing this asap, the whole procedual way to do Phase 3 Tests in Brazil and India is chosen - people are vaccinated and then we wait and wait and wait how many of these people get sick and how many do not. Then we make a statistical comparison, looking how many of the infected people had the real vaccine and how many then placebo. That's highly ineffective when many thousands of people are dying day by day. So be sure - Russia did (or does) perform Human Challenge trials to get some information on the effectiveness. 

Again: Putin is no man who would go that public if they haven't gathered some evenident data about the effectiveness. They are just  leaving out procedures that are too slow and mean too much bureaucracy and waiting for the current situation and are replacing them with methods that may be unusual and maybe even ""unethical"".. But they are no mad super villain scientists who are willing to kill millions of people for their goals. They still are serious, rational scientists.

> In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. With rapidly accumulating cases and deaths reported globally2, a vaccine is urgently needed. We report the available safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose escalation study among 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, randomized to receive 2 doses, separated by 21 days, of 10 µg, 30 µg, or 100 µg of BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. A second vaccination with 100 µg was not administered due to increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared to the 30 μg dose. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.9- to 4.6-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera at least 14 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04368728).

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 μg of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.",2,0.048,0.05,0.902,-0.3352

## Abstract

Vaccine  efforts against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic are focused  on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing  antibodies. Here, we performed cryo-EM and site-specific glycan analysis  of one of the leading subunit vaccine candidates from Novavax based on a  full-length spike protein formulated in polysorbate 80 (PS 80)  detergent. Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the  spike immunogen with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to  published spike ectodomain structures. Interestingly, we also observed  novel interactions between the spike trimers allowing formation of  higher order spike complexes. This study confirms the structural  integrity of the full-length spike protein immunogen and provides a  basis for interpreting immune responses to this multivalent nanoparticle  immunogen.",28,0.115,0.018,0.868,0.9062

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, and virtually completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.",1,0.098,0.036,0.865,0.704

**Background**

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS−CoV−2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID−19), have spread to millions of people globally. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. 

**Methods**

Healthy adults 18−55 and 65−85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo−controlled, observer−blinded dose−escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21−day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle−formulated, nucleoside−modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS−CoV−2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS−CoV−2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. 

**Results**

In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS−CoV−2−neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS−CoV−2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. 

**Conclusion**

These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2/3 large−scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.",8,0.106,0.018,0.876,0.9743
g271nuq,2020-08-20," **Abstract**

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to public health, economic, and social consequences that mandate urgent development of effective vaccines to contain or eradicate infection. To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.",3,0.166,0.0,0.834,0.9741

One way to do this, is to deliberately expose the trial group to the disease and track whether they get sick or not.

One of the requirements is that the disease should have an effective treatment, in case the test subjects to fall ill. Covid-19 does not have such a treatment.

Another approach is to inject a large group of test subjects with the vaccine candidate and another group with a placebo (ideally something that triggers a similar set of side effects) and then simply send them home to live their lives normally, while checking up on them from time to time to see if they've contracted the illness.

Eventually, you should start seeing some people in the placebo group become infected, while (hopefully) the group that received the actual vaccine has no cases.

Highlights

Selecting optimal epitopes is essential for vaccine safety and efficacy

We report 65 vaccine peptides predicted to drive long-term immunity in most people

Epitopes contain domains conserved in 15 coronaviruses and newly evolved SARS2 regions

Epitopes can be used to generate B and/or T cell vaccines (RNA and DNA)

Summary

Here we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design concept based on identification of highly conserved regions of the viral genome and newly acquired adaptations, both predicted to generate epitopes presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II across the vast majority of the population. We further prioritize genomic regions that generate highly dissimilar peptides from the human proteome and are also predicted to produce B cell epitopes. We propose sixty-five 33-mer peptide sequences, a subset of which can be tested using DNA or mRNA delivery strategies. These include peptides that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor and within a newly evolved furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. Validation and implementation of this vaccine concept could specifically target specific vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the population.",3,0.088,0.007,0.905,0.9371

Vaccines may train the immune system more efficiently than actual exposure - so eventual infection after a vaccine followed by exposure isn't a guarantee even if it is shown to recur in the short term from a natural infection. In addition, the % of infection may not be that high: we are confirming re-infection, but it doesn't mean that everyone (or even anyone more than a tiny minority, based on current info) is susceptible to reinfection within a short period of time.

Statistically, a decent percentage of people end up not getting the booster, and so it's important to know what that looks like.  In fact, they've administered over 30k vaccines in trials so far, a non-zero percentage of those people will end up not getting the booster for some reason (health, life changes, bad reactions, drop out of trial, actually caught the virus, etc) and that data is important and will be reported upon.

1 - (Infection Rate of Test Group / Infection Rate of Control Group) = Efficacy

As a more real world example, let's say they choose 20% as the threshold and the test group has 1% infection rate at that point:

1 - (.01 / .20) = .95 or 95% efficacy

If the vaccine isn't very effective, you might end up with numbers like this:

1 - (.15 / .20) = .25 or 25% efficacy

Most likely the numbers will be somewhere between that (no vaccine is perfect).

g3msgha,2020-09-01,"Abstract

Effective and safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are highly desirable to prevent casualties and societal cost caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface-exposed spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a suitable target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs. Here we prepared and analyzed the response to several DNA vaccines based on genetic fusions of RBD to four different scaffolding domains, namely to the foldon peptide, ferritin, lumazine synthase and β-annulus peptide, presenting from 6 to 60 copies of the RBD on each particle. Scaffolding strongly augmented the immune response with production of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response including cytotoxic lymphocytes in mice upon immunization with DNA plasmids. The most potent response was observed for the 24-residue β-annulus peptide scaffold that forms large soluble assemblies, that has the advantage of low immunogenicity in comparison to larger scaffolds. Our results support the advancement of this vaccine platform towards clinical trials.",1,0.12,0.023,0.856,0.9498

g3p886z,2020-09-01,"I think the media is over-simplifying things by presenting this as if there is a single Phase 3 trial that ends at a certain deadline and then the vaccine is either definitely proved to be ""good"" or ""bad"". That's not how this is going to work.

There are lots of competing questions for a trial to answer:

* What dose and dosing schedule is the minimum needed to be protective?
* How long does protection last?
* How does protection vary by age group?
* How does protection vary by pre-existing condition (like HIV)?
* And so on...

Then there are lots of competing political questions:

* Will a country like the US (or UK) approve the vaccine if the Phase 3 trial was done entirely in other countries? Generally they wouldn't, but this is a pandemic. Maybe they would approve it temporarily but require better evidence for long-term approval?
* How statistically certain do we have to be that a vaccine is protective to get emergency use auth? What about for long-term approval? 
* What level of protection is good enough for emergency use auth (Probably 50% w/ the FDA)? What about long-term approval?
* What do we do if we have good evidence that the vaccine works in one age group (the young and healthy) but no evidence that it works in another (the elderly)? Do we approve it for everyone or just some people? Do we run another trial?
* What if we have a really good signal in a small trial (like the n=5k trial in Brazil) but the US wants an n=30k trial for approval?

All of this is complicated by the fact that a double blind trail essential can ""shoot its shot"" once. So you have to wait until you feel like ""enough"" people have tested positive for COVID and then decide to unblind the trial and pray that you got enough statistical information to draw a strong conclusion. The worst outcome would be running the trial and then unblinding too early and not knowing for sure if the vaccine did anything because the data is too sparse to reach a statistically significant conclusion.

In normal times, you would just run the vaccine trial for a year and check out the end of the year. But right now, we are racing the clock. So it's a high-risk gamble - wait for more data to maximize chance of a strong result vs. stop as soon as you think you might have enough data risking that your entire trial could be a waste.

So the only logical answer is to run as many trials as you can in as many places as you can with as many different configurations as you can to maximize the number of shots you have and maximize the amount of information you can collect. Maybe the first trial result gets you enough data to get emergency use authorization and then the subsequent trials can be allowed to run longer to collect more convincing data for long-term approval or to better inform dosing or treatment in different ages and pre-existing conditions.

Thus, the Oxford vaccine is currently being trialed in four countries:

* UK: Groups for different age ranges including children and the elderly, groups to test repeat ChAdOx-1 vaccination immunity, groups to test different doses, etc, but all subject to very low infection rates.
* South Africa: Higher infection rates and additional groups to test vaccine on HIV+ patients
* Brazil: Testing high infection rates in mainly at-risk jobs, just trying to get a result ASAP
* US: Wide coverage of age ranges (similar to what the UK is already doing). My *guess* is that this trial is not aimed at getting emergency use authorization ASAP, but at getting real approval for the long term.

Any one of those trials concluding does not make the other trials less valuable. Plus, the Oxford team already got burned once. They said that their statisticians told them initially that they would have results by June because of the earlier high infection rate in the UK. That obviously didn't happen because the infection rate dropped very quickly during lockdown. They know that any country could see the same infection rate drop within weeks.

The doctors involved in the study report every incidence of infection or of side effects to the company running the trial. That data is dumped into a big database which people running the trail monitor in an ongoing way.

The first concern is safety. For example, there was a hydroxychloroquine study that was stopped early because the people looking at the data as it came in said something to the effect of, ""holy shit, this drug is killing people, stop the trial."" 

But also, a vaccine trial isn't something where you just count down a certain number of days and then declare your findings. What you're looking for is for enough people in your control group to get the disease, and to have the disease run its course. Then you compare that to your patients who actually go the vaccine and see if there's a big enough difference. 

But how long that takes is out of your control. For example, there was a UK vaccine trial where they expected to have results quickly but the country did a good enough job of locking down that infections fell off and their control groups wasn't getting sick. This is also why the MERS vaccine which the Oxford vaccine is a close relative of hasn't gotten through phase III trials yet - not enough people are getting the disease.

There’s two components of that: 1) we don’t want healthcare workers getting sick in large numbers, which would compromise our capacity and 2) we don’t want the elderly and vulnerable to get sick in huge numbers, because that would overwhelm our hospitals.

If you vaccinate healthcare workers in the emergency use, you take care of the first problem. If you vaccinate the elderly and vulnerable, even if the vaccine is not as efficacious in those populations, that will still go a *long* way towards basically addressing the second population.

Pre-clinical studies show promising safety and immunogenicity.

Over 400 participants being enrolled in Phase 1/2 study

Pending positive Phase 1/2 data, companies aim to move into Phase 3 by end of 2020

Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant with the target of producing up to one billion doses in 2021

PARIS and LONDON – Sept. 3, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK today started the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate, developed in partnership by Sanofi and GSK, uses the same recombinant protein-based technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines with GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant technology.

The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity (tolerability) and immunogenicity (immune response) of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A total of 440 healthy adults are being enrolled in the trial across 11 investigational sites in the United States.

The companies anticipate first results early December 2020 which will support the initiation of a Phase 3 trial in December 2020. If data are sufficient for licensure application, the plan is to request regulatory approval in the first half of 2021.

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Preclinical data showed an acceptable reactogenicity profile and data based on two injections of the adjuvanted recombinant vaccine showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies that are comparable to levels in humans who recovered from the COVID-19 infection. Pre-clinical results will be published later this year. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant with the target of producing up to one billion doses in 2021.

“Sanofi and GSK bring proven science and technology to the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic, with the shared objective of delivering a safe and effective vaccine,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “The initiation of our clinical study is an important step and brings us closer to a potential vaccine which could help defeat COVID-19. Our dedicated teams and partner continue to work around the clock as we aim to deliver the first results in early December. Positive data will enable a prompt start of the pivotal phase 3 trial by the end of this year.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, “Moving this vaccine candidate into clinical development is an important moment in the progress towards addressing the global pandemic we are all facing. This builds on the confidence shown by governments already in the potential of this protein-based adjuvanted vaccine candidate, which utilizes established technology from both companies, and can be produced at scale by two of the leading vaccine manufacturers globally. We now look forward to the data from the study, and if positive, beginning Phase 3 by the end of the year.”

### Background

We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.

### Methods

We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18–60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-γ concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/), [NCT04436471](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04436471) and [NCT04437875](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04437875).

### Findings

Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 \[58%\]), hyperthermia (38 \[50%\]), headache (32 \[42%\]), asthenia (21 \[28%\]), and muscle and joint pain (18 \[24%\]). **Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein.** At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

### Interpretation

The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants. Further investigation is needed of the effectiveness of this vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

A quick check on worldometer and the US has been averaging more than 41,000 confirmed cases a day since late June. Let's round up to 45,000 average over the past 6 weeks. That takes us to roughly 1/7500 persons per day getting infected. So the trial's should comfortably be seeing 4 persons infected with COVID per day by the end of the next week.

But, when you account for the fact that these trials are likely being conducted in ""hot zones"" and major cities, the chances go up. So even a modest 33% increase chance (probably much more but let's be conservative) of infection takes us to 1/5000 persons infected per day, and 6 people per day per trial. At that rate, this trial will hit the 180 infections within 30 days.

We report the development and evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of a whole virion inactivated SARS-COV-2 vaccine (BBV152), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide gel (Algel), or a novel TLR7/8 agonist adsorbed Algel. We used a well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 strain and an established vero cell platform to produce large-scale GMP grade highly purified inactivated antigen, BBV152. Product development and manufacturing were carried out in a BSL-3 facility. Immunogenicity was determined at two antigen concentrations (3μg and 6μg), with two different adjuvants, in mice, rats, and rabbits. Our results show that BBV152 vaccine formulations generated significantly high antigen-binding and neutralizing antibody titers, at both concentrations, in all three species with excellent safety profiles. The inactivated vaccine formulation containing TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant-induced Th1 biased antibody responses with elevated IgG2a/IgG1 ratio and increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN-γ+ CD4 T lymphocyte response.

No serious side effects were reported that require immediate treatment. The vaccine was tried in 1,000 participants with chronic diseases, and no complications occurred.

 The vaccine was evaluated based on approval qualification criteria for emergency use. The criteria include: The global health authorities declare an emergency, provide scientific evidence on the effectiveness of the product and the benefits outweigh the risks, and the manufacturer’s request to authorize the vaccine. Emergency use takes into account several factors, including: target groups, product characteristics, clinical and pre-clinical study data, population study, and all relevant available scientific evidence. The health authorities, in coordination with the implementing company, followed many measures to control the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine. These measures include emergency use of the product, identification of target groups, dosage and vaccination regimen.

ETA: The discussion of a desirable clinical end point that maximize public health benefit is is new to me. Something to chew

>***Clinical end point***. It is crucial to choose an end  point that is likely to reflect the desired relevant public health  benefit. Possible end points for consideration in COVID-19 vaccine  trials include clinical disease of varying severity and/or asymptomatic  infection. Vaccines for respiratory and other mucosal viruses  historically have greater efficacy against more severe rather than  milder disease and are less likely to affect asymptomatic infection. In  addition, use of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as an end point may  be [operationally  challenging and result in a large number of false-positive test results  and possibly even failure to demonstrate vaccine efficacy](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/499/eaat0360.full). By  contrast, use of a clinical end point requiring signs or symptoms of  pneumonia may result in earlier demonstration of vaccine efficacy, as  this limits the number of cases of vaccine-induced disease attenuation  (that is, people with SARS-CoV-2 infection but only mild, residual  clinical symptoms following vaccination) included in the primary  efficacy analysis. Thus, the rate of occurrence of the end point in the  population under consideration, the importance of the vaccine’s impact  on the end point and the reliability in measuring the end point should  be considered when defining an end point.  
>  
>It is important to  maintain some flexibility in the clinical end point definition in a  pandemic situation involving a novel pathogen because there is limited  knowledge of pathogen-specific disease presentation and underlying  pathophysiology. This flexibility enables the collection of clinical  case data in early-stage clinical trials, with vaccine efficacy being  established in later-stage trials using an evolved case definition based  on emerging knowledge. Infection or disease end points not included to  address an efficacy trial primary objective should, however, be assessed  as secondary end points.",4,0.091,0.019,0.89,0.9544

This is the number of participants initially targeted for Phase 2/3 and may be adjusted based on advice from DMC analyses of case accumulation and the percentage of participants who are seropositive at baseline. Dependent upon the evolution of the pandemic, it is possible that the COVID-19 attack rate may be much higher, in which case accrual would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study’s primary endpoint to be evaluated much sooner.

Your placebo group needs to be recruited from the same population as your vaccine group. People are recruited and only then are they assigned to one of the trials. 

So, if, say, Pfizer recruited people for their trial in Los Angeles (which they did) they need a placebo group in Los Angeles. Having a placebo group that doesn't *exactly* match the recruiting criteria for the vaccine group introduces a whole new variable. e.g., now you don't know if your vaccine group did better than your placebo group because of the drug, or because the region they were in did a better job of controlling the virus, people around there started socially distancing more or wearing masks more, etc.

g6cnicu,2020-09-23,"Yes, they don't know if any of these vaccines work at what defectiveness (none of the companies) in humans yet.

Let's say you give a vaccine to 1 person then you intentionally challenge them with the virus (they aren't doing this but it was talked about). The person doesn't get sick. Does that mean your vaccine works? Maybe. Or maybe that person wouldn't have gotten sick for another reason. Or maybe the challenge wasn't like natural infection. Or other factors.

So even in a pretty controlled experiment you don't get answers in this kind of science without statistics. Once you have to use statistics you start asking and answering questions based on how likely or unlikely a result could be due to random chance. For a single person you learn pretty much nothing. 

The phase 3 studies that have enrolled 30,000 people require about 150 people to get sick in the populations to have a reasonable certainty of answering the question of if the vaccine works or not. They have to just get sick by naturally going about their life. If statistically more get sick in the control group than the vaccine group the vaccine works with the ratio saying something about how well. If the same number get sick the vaccine doesn't work.

What is known now are correlates of immunity. The vaccines are known to raise an immune response. That \*suggests\* they will work, but it doesn't prove that they do. Beyond efficacy you also have to look for rare side effects. If 1 person in 15,000 has a bad outcome you probably won't give a particular vaccine to a 20 year old but you might be willing to give it to a 70 year old, because the risk of death in the 70-80 age group might be 1 in 100 if they catch the disease but it is only 1 in 10,000 in the 20-30 age group say. (The actual numbers here are made up and just an example). Phase 3 studies are large enough to see effects comparable to the risk of the disease. So at least for short term complications we will know if the vaccine is less or more risk than the disease. If it is significantly less risk then it will be used if it isn't it will be thrown out.

g6doc98,2020-09-23,"ERVEBO is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)[A lyssavirus, a relative of rabies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdoviridae?wprov=sfti1).  VSV is primarily a disease of livestock in the American Midwest and it is transmitted by mosquitos.  As its name implies, it causes painful vesicles (blisters) on the mouth, anus, and udder of infected animals, although they usually recover completely.  When it infects humans, it doesn’t replicate very well and usually causes mild flu-like symptoms for a day or two.  Virologically, it’s interesting because it only has structural genes and no nonstructural genes (structural proteins are found in the virion, while nonstructural proteins are made by the virus inside the infected cell and are involved in replication but are not carried in the virion itself).  

The virus itself is enveloped with a single surface glycoprotein called G.  To make ERVEBO, G was replaced with the surface glycoprotein from Ebolavirus.  This further attenuates the VSV, but it means that the new VSV particle will be coated with the Ebolavirus surface glycoprotein, so even if the host has antibodies to VSV, they won’t stop the new ERVEBO.  The virus binds to cells, starts to replicate (but isn’t very good at it) and the patient develops immunity to the surface glycoprotein.

So this platform can be used with any enveloped virus that has a single surface glycoprotein (I’m not sure if it would be possible to use it on something like a paramyxovirus, which has two major surface glycoproteins, H and F).  Well, coronaviruses have a single surface glycoprotein called S (spike).  So Merck is taking that spike gene and putting it where the G gene was and developing it into a virus.  And prior use of a VSV-vectored vaccine such as ERVEBO won’t matter because the new vaccine virus will have a new surface glycoprotein.

g6k0vso,2020-09-24,"Not much has changed, but you are raising several issues at the same time. Let me try to address them one at a time.

5-6 months ago no one knew much to anything about the bodies' immune response to this virus, or its mutation rate.

If a virus mutates quickly making a vaccine with high efficacy is difficult because the virus you generate the immune response to no longer exists by the time you have a vaccine. SARS-COV-2 has things in its genome to keep it stabilized and so it isn't appear to mutate quickly.

When is a vaccine not a vaccine? When your body forgets. 

Raising high levels of anti-bodies or T-cells isn't enough to have a ""vaccine"". Yes you have a vaccine but not in the sense that you might be thinking of. Measles I got my vaccine and now I'm good or even Tetanus, I get a booster every 5 years or whatever. The immune response memory to other coronavirus, including the common cold ones, seems to be quite short. We don't know yet how long the immune memory is for any of these vaccines or natural infection.

For natural infection we have clues it is more than a few months. People now speculate that the T-cell stuff might last years. If so great, but its worth scientifically pointing out that we don't know yet how long immunity lasts or how well. We will find that out over the next few years. 

One of the reasons it takes so long to make a regular vaccine is that they answer these questions comprehensively before they release it. Want to know if people have long term immunity? Wait a long time. They also don't start phase 3 trials the day they release a pre-print of their phase 2 data. They also don't invest billions of dollars in trials until they know they have something pretty good.

The US has greatly subsidized everything so that speed can be maximized. What will not be known is if there are long term side effects or long term immunity when these vaccines are distributed. Best case you will have about 6 months of safety and efficacy data when doses for large numbers of the general public become available in Spring 2021 (in the western countries). 

It should be noted that your immune response is not likely to be perfect for 6 months then 0. It will just fade so if the vaccines are safe enough to distribute, to take the US as an example you could go from 10-20% immune to 60-70% immune in 3-6 months which would let people return to normal more or less. Then as the immune response fades you would slowly see more cases again and you would know it was time to boost everyone. You'd be monitoring the disease mutations in the wild and have tweaked your spike protein to update the vaccine. Essentially it is reasonable to expect Q3 of 2021 to be ""back to normal"" via a vaccine or capitulation to infection in the United States. I'd expect a strong push for mass vaccination to conclude in Aug 2021. It will depend on how bad it gets over the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.",1,0.145,0.022,0.833,0.9974
g6ip2m2,2020-09-24,"Within the first year or so, it will mostly be a matter of delivery logistics.

Some of the vaccines require very cold temperatures during the entire chain from production to injection. Others don't have such strict requirements. It's much easier to deliver sub-zero products en masse to urban centers because you can put a few thousand doses in a big super-cooled box and then use them all soon after opening the box. You are also likely to have better existing infrastructure for storing super-cooled goods in urban centers. It's much less efficient to deliver these vaccines to very rural areas where you only need 50 doses since you can't use up a box of 1000 doses immediately. We can't afford to waste doses like that. So you would funnel the cold-chain vaccines to urban centers and the non-cold-chain vaccines to rural areas.

This is just one factor. There are a million other factors. For example, you also have to deal with scheduling second doses of two-dose vaccines - thus requiring the same vaccine to be available again in the same area, not two doses of two different vaccines. So you probably don't want a mix of different vaccines within a single geography if you can help it. It would just complicate matters and makes it possible for people to get mixed up on which vaccine they had last time. It would be more efficient to send different vaccines to different geographies.

So in the early days when demand far outstrips vaccine supply, vaccines will be distributed based on the distribution and administration requirements of each vaccine more than anything else.

Multiple vaccines are in  development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available.   METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded,  placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity  and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26  based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of  SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or  1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or  as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years  old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old;  cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were  measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type  virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and  CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining  (ICS).   RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety  data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data  from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events  were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited  systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants,  respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade  3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and  resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local  adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent  solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single  dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50)  at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs  of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295)  for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar  immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in  cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6)  (GMTs of 196 \[95%CI: 69;  560\]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 \[95% CI: <58; 327\])  were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively.  Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL)   was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 \[95% CI: 442;  630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810\]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose  level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3  with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506),  respectively.

CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3,  for both dose levels.

g6z9h46,2020-09-28,"If the trials included a lot of people over 65, they might have hard time reaching their efficiency criteria. Vaccines in general do not work that well for the elderly because the immune system is already failing due to advanced age. I can understand why they would first mostly target people with functioning immune systems in order to start vaccinations earlier.

[https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(19)30039-3](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(19)30039-3)

It is possible to improve vaccine efficiency in the elderly, but that will take years and the improvements will be steps at a time. Even so, even the ""older"" vaccines do not perfectly protect the most frail from influenza or other contagious diseases and they are a very common cause of death in nursing homes.

That said, it would be important to ensure the safety of the vaccine in those age groups as the vaccination will still help, even though it isn't as effective.

From the paper:

>Some have argued that only vaccination of younger populations is needed to achieve herd immunity (67% level of immunity),[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771091#ild200063r6) and therefore, vaccination of older adults is not essential

I'm not completely sure if we can reach elimination-level herd immunity in the short term (next couple of years) with a vaccine in any case. Are the vaccines even mass tested on children in phase 3?

If not, you probably can't blindly mass vaccinate hundreds of millions of children who have extremely low risk of severe outcomes to start with.

So, we basically have only the 18-65 age bracket to vaccinate hoping for immunity. If we reach 70% coverage with 50% neutralization efficiency in that age bracket, we won't be even close to  mentioned 60-70% level in general. People over 65 will be vaccinated too, but the vaccine efficiency will be most likely a lot lower.

Because of this I'd be careful when advocating for elimination or eradication schemes which will make the world ""safe"" again. There's a high risk that this won't happen.

The world never was safe before, so it would probably be wise to start selling the idea of influenza level mortality as the ""safe and normal"" situation which we can most likely reach.",34,0.13,0.115,0.755,0.1449
g6ynxd3,2020-09-28," **Discussion**

Our findings indicate that older adults are likely to be excluded from more than 50% of COVID-19 clinical trials and 100% of vaccine trials. Such exclusion will limit the ability to evaluate the efficacy, dosage, and adverse effects of the intended treatments. We acknowledge that some exclusions for severe or uncontrolled comorbidities will be essential to protect the health and safety of older adults. However, caution must be taken to avoid excluding otherwise eligible participants for reasons that are not well-justified. A limitation of this study is that we did not conduct detailed review of every study protocol; thus, we were unable to fully evaluate the appropriateness of all comorbidity exclusions.

Our concern is more than theoretical. Even without stated age-based exclusions, several recently published clinical trials of COVID-19 treatments had young age ranges, such as 1 recent study[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771091#ild200063r4) with a median age of only 40 years, meaning there would be no or few participants over age 75.

If the older age group is excluded from vaccine trials, efforts to ensure effectiveness, titrate dosage or frequency, and assess adverse effects in the group most vulnerable to COVID-19 will not be possible. Antibody responses to vaccines may decrease with age, and can improve with increasing antigen levels, adjuvants, or repeated dosing.[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771091#ild200063r5) Some have argued that only vaccination of younger populations is needed to achieve herd immunity (67% level of immunity),[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771091#ild200063r6) and therefore, vaccination of older adults is not essential; however, the high level of immunity required, coupled with the fact that many settings (eg, nursing homes) are comprised nearly exclusively of older adults, highlights the imperative for their inclusion in COVID-19 vaccine trials.

With advanced preparation, staff training, and aging expertise, enrollment of older adults is feasible, allowing COVID-19 clinical trials to be as relevant and inclusive as possible.",7,0.053,0.079,0.868,-0.7653

BACKGROUND
Testing of vaccine candidates to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an older population is important, since increased incidences of illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been associated with an older age.

METHODS
We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart.

RESULTS
Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.

CONCLUSIONS
In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

g7a590u,2020-10-01,"EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has started the first ‘rolling review’ of a COVID-19 vaccine, which is being developed by the company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford. 

The start of the rolling review means that the committee has started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, which come from laboratory studies (non-clinical data). This does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee.

A rolling review is one of the regulatory tools that the Agency uses to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency. Normally, all data on a medicine’s effectiveness, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a formal application for marketing authorisation. In the case of a rolling review, the CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before deciding that sufficient data are available and that a formal application should be submitted by the company.

The CHMP’s decision to start the rolling review of the vaccine is based on preliminary results from non-clinical and early clinical studies suggesting that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and T cells (cells of the immune system, the body’s natural defences) that target the virus. 

Large-scale clinical trials involving several thousands of people are ongoing, and results will become available over the coming weeks and months. These results will provide information on how effective the vaccine is in protecting people against COVID-19 and will be assessed in later rolling review cycles. All the available data on the safety of the vaccine emerging from these studies, as well as data on its quality (such as its ingredients and the way it is produced), will also be reviewed.  

The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available to support a formal marketing authorisation application. 

EMA will complete its assessment according to its usual standards for quality, safety and effectiveness. While the overall review timeline cannot be forecast yet, the process should be shorter than a regular evaluation due to the time gained during the rolling review. The rolling review process has been used previously in the assessment of the COVID-19 medicine, Veklury (remdesivir).",35,0.075,0.009,0.916,0.9741

NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, October 6, 2020 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for BNT162b2, the lead candidate from the companies’ vaccine development program against COVID-19. The EMA’s decision to start a rolling review follows the encouraging preliminary results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies in adults, which suggest that BNT162b2 triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies and TH-1 dominant CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that target SARS-CoV-2. A combination of an antibody and T cell response is believed to be important in eliciting protection against viral infection and disease. BioNTech and Pfizer plan to work with the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to complete the rolling review process to facilitate the final Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).

> As part of the rolling review, the CHMP has begun evaluating data generated in pre-clinical trials. The formal MAA submission could be finalized following the rolling review process, pending demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety and confirmation from the EMA that the submitted data are adequate. The vaccine candidate will remain subject to the EMA’s diligent standards for quality, safety and efficacy.

> “It is our duty to ensure that while we are working to develop a potential vaccine at unprecedented speed to help address this pandemic, we do so with the highest ethical standards while adhering to sound scientific principles. We will continue to have regular and open dialogue with the EMA throughout the rolling review process,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

> “A global crisis the magnitude of COVID-19 has completely transformed the vaccine development and review process,” said Peter Honig, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Worldwide Safety and Regulatory of Pfizer. “We are making every effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies and are proud to take this historic step with the European Medicines Agency for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2.”

 > The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. It encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is a target of virus neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 study ongoing at more than 120 clinical sites worldwide including the United States, Brazil, South Africa and Argentina. To date, the trial has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants with more than 28,000 having received their second vaccination.

> Preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 portions of the study have demonstrated that BNT162b2 was well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events in all age groups. The vaccine candidate generated dose level-dependent immunogenicity, as measured by receptor binding domain (RBD)-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. In addition, BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and BNT162b2 demonstrated a concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses which were TH-1 dominant against the RBD and the remainder of the full spike glycoprotein. Full information on previously released data can be found here. For further information about the ongoing Phase 3 trial, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov using the number NCT04368728.

> Normally, all data on an investigational medicine’s efficacy, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a complete application for marketing authorization. In the case of a rolling review, the EMA’s CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before a complete application is submitted. Once the CHMP decides that sufficient data are available, the complete application should be submitted by the company. By reviewing the data as they become available, the CHMP can reach its opinion sooner on whether or not the investigational medicine or vaccine should be authorized.

The granting of a provisional determination means that the TGA has made a decision that AstraZeneca is now eligible to apply for provisional registration for the vaccine in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

Provisional determination is the first step in the process and does not mean that an application has or will be made, or that the vaccine will be provisionally approved for inclusion in the ARTG.

Normally for a vaccine to be registered in Australia, a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) is required to submit a complete and comprehensive package of data to the TGA. A formal evaluation is then carried out in multiple stages by technical experts, prior to a decision being made.

The provisional pathway provides a formal and transparent mechanism for speeding up the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data. In order to apply for provisional registration, the sponsor must first apply for a provisional determination. Further information on eligibility criteria can be found at: Provisional determination: A step-by-step guide for prescription medicines.

In making its decision to grant AstraZeneca a provisional determination, the TGA considered all eligibility criteria, including factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data and the seriousness of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to this determination, the TGA is actively monitoring COVID-19 vaccine development that is occurring both in Australia and around the world, and is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the establishment of systems for monitoring the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines once they have reached the market.

Because there are abstract commonalities that you can use when you have enough experience in a given area. 

Simple example: you're an independent contractor with over a decade of experience in your field.  You need to quote out a project to build something you've never specifically done before.  But you've built enough intuitive knowledge in the field to have a reasonably accurate picture in your head of all the components and how they will come together.

It's kind of like that.

When vaccines have had ""long term"" issues it's because it took that long to get them into enough trial subjects for one of them to have the rare adverse reaction, or for enough people in the trial group to get the disease to prove the null result (no efficacy). It's precisely because in a normal situation you don't get an immediate flood of participants when you start a trial, and the disease you're vaccinating against isn't rampant, it slows down the trial process and your chances of having an early failure considerably.

Recruiting for these vaccine trials has been incredibly fast, and the pandemic status of the disease means if the trial takes place in a 'hot spot' you could potentially see infections in the control group happen very quickly.

Remember how a vaccine works. You get one or two doses, and over the course of about six weeks your body generates an immune response. Almost all the side effects are going to happen immediately after dosing (in the two-dose trials, usually after the second dose specifically) and then if some sort of neurological side effect occurs it's going to show in the weeks after.

g8q7cku,2020-10-13,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 13, 2020-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This initiation follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the positive interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (ages 18-55 years) and older adults (ages 56-70 and 71+) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The rolling submission has been accepted under the Canadian Minister of Health's Interim Order, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data and information as they become available. This rolling review process allows Health Canada to begin its assessment using the information submitted by the applicant and accept new evidence as it becomes available until the application is deemed complete. This process can reduce time to authorization for these important new drugs while maintaining appropriate standards of safety, efficacy, and quality. Health Canada will not make a decision to authorize any vaccine being considered under rolling review until it has received all necessary evidence to support its safety and efficacy. Following the authorization of any vaccine submission, Health Canada will publish the evidence used in making its decision for transparency.

On September 22, the Canadian Government increased its confirmed order commitment to 20 million doses of mRNA-1273. Moderna remains on track to be able to deliver up to 56 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to help protect Canadians beginning in 2021. The Canadian vaccine supply will be sourced from Moderna’s European production capacity with its strategic manufacturing partner Lonza of Switzerland, and ROVI of Spain for fill-finish services.

“We are pleased with the interactions with the Canadian regulatory authorities and we appreciate their guidance and confidence in Moderna to pursue a rolling submission in Canada for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to developing a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies around the world and we will continue working closely with Health Canada.”

The Phase 1 interim analysis showed that mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated across all age groups and induced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In the 18-55 age group, neutralizing antibody titers were observed in 100% of evaluated participants and at the 100 µg dose level selected for Phase 3, the geometric mean titers were above those seen in convalescent sera. Similarly, mRNA-1273 induced consistently high levels of pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers in all participants in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups. In addition, vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited Th1-biased CD4 T cell responses in all age groups.

mRNA-1273 is currently being studied in a Phase 3 randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial of 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U.S. As of Friday, October 9, the Phase 3 COVE study has enrolled approximately 28,618 participants with 22,194 having received their second vaccination.

In another locked thread, there was a debate about the merits of pursuing ""natural herd immunity"" vs. continued lockdowns.  

I predict that if we have to wait until 2022 for a vaccine, we will have already reached ""natural herd immunity,"" like it or not.  It is true that the growth of the virus at this point is not exponential because of physical distancing, but it will grow and it will infect more people.  

For me, it's been frustrating.  I have now attempted to sign up for four vaccine trials (Pfizer/BNT, Moderna, AZ, and J&J).  In all four cases, I could not sign up because of a lack of capacity.  

I'm not sure what the solution is at this time.  Do we need to rethink the merits of the blinding in the face of objective data?  Should we consider releasing the vaccine to volunteers who are not enrolled in a formal trial under compassionate use?  There are serious problems with such approaches.

But one thing that is absolutely true is that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  We need a vaccine ASAP if we want to avoid reaching ""natural herd immunity"" by default.

Moreover, the first polio vaccine was actually quite ineffective, with an efficacy of only about 50%.  That didn't stop Albert Sabin from developing OPV, and then Sanofi developed IPOL.  

But I hope that what comes out of this pandemic is a few things: 1) I hope that RNA vaccines are successful and are demonstrated to be a good response to a pandemic of a novel virus.  2) We need to start pre-emptively developing vaccines for the various families of viruses that can infect mammals.  The list is not enormous.  *Paramyxoviridae*, *Orthomyxoviridae*, *Picornaviridae* (the idea of a novel Picornavirus pandemic especially terrifies me because picornavirus particles are so sturdy), *Orthopoxviridae*, *Orthocoronaviridae*, *Toroviridae*, *Arenaviridae*, *Reoviridae*, *Filoviridae*, etc.  That way, when one emerges, we can have a vaccine for it in a matter of months because we already know how to make those vaccines.

In the end, a good response to these emerging viruses will seem unimportant and will not make the news.  Few people will ever hear about Nipah because we already have a promising vaccine candidate.

> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 14, 2020-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq:MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that it has received written confirmation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, is eligible for submission of an application for a European Union Marketing Authorization under the Agency’s centralized procedure. Confirmation of eligibility was given in response to the submission of a letter of intent enabling Moderna to evaluate the opportunity for submitting a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for mRNA-1273 with the EMA. This submission follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study and the positive interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (ages 18-55 years) and older adults (ages 56-70 and 71+) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

> Moderna appreciates the EMA’s effective response to this serious public health emergency by establishing a Fast-Track framework, which includes rapid scientific advice, rolling review, and accelerated assessment.

> “We are pleased with the productive interactions with the European regulatory authorities at the National level and at the EMA level to date and we appreciate their valuable guidance and confidence in Moderna to pursue an MAA submission for approval in Europe for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273. European partners, investors and citizens have been part of Moderna from the beginning of the company and have played an important role in Moderna’s progress,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to developing a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies and we will continue our ongoing dialogue with the EMA. Moderna is scaling up global manufacturing to be able to deliver approximately 500 million doses per year and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021.”

> In Europe, the Company is working with its strategic manufacturing partners, Lonza of Switzerland and ROVI of Spain, for manufacturing and fill-finish outside of the United States. This is a dedicated supply chain to support Europe and countries other than the United States that enter into purchase agreements with Moderna.

> The Phase 1 interim analysis showed that mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated across all age groups and induced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In the 18-55 age group, neutralizing antibody titers were observed in 100% of evaluated participants and at the 100 µg dose level selected for Phase 3, the geometric mean titers were above those seen in convalescent sera. Similarly, mRNA-1273 induced consistently high levels of pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers in all participants in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups. In addition, vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited Th1-biased CD4 T cell responses in all age groups.

We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents' blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.",3,0.042,0.009,0.949,0.7717

**Background**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans.

**Methods**

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18–80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18–59 years and ≥60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18–59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 μg on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 μg on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459.

**Findings**

In phase 1, 192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53·7 years [SD 15·6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 μg [n=24], 4 μg [n=24], or 8 μg [n=24] for both age groups [18–59 years and ≥60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18–59 years, one [4%] in the 2 μg group, one [4%] in the 4 μg group, and two [8%] in the 8 μg group; ≥60 years, one [4%] in the 8 μg group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18–59 years (87·7 [95% CI 64·9–118·6], 2 μg group; 211·2 [158·9–280·6], 4 μg group; and 228·7 [186·1–281·1], 8 μg group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80·7 [65·4–99·6], 2 μg group; 131·5 [108·2–159·7], 4 μg group; and 170·87 [133·0–219·5], 8 μg group) compared with the placebo group (2·0 [2·0–2·0]). In phase 2, 448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41·7 years [SD 9·9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 μg on day 0 [n=84] or 4 μg on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 μg day 0; 18 [21%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 μg days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 μg day 0; one [1%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 μg days 0 and 14 (169·5, 95% CI 132·2–217·1), days 0 and 21 (282·7, 221·2–361·4), and days 0 and 28 (218·0, 181·8–261·3) schedules than the 8 μg day 0 schedule (14·7, 11·6–18·8; all p<0·001).

**Interpretation**

The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 μg vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 μg dose or 4 μg dose on days 0 and 14.",4,0.031,0.029,0.94,0.259

Establishing new experimental animal models to assess the safety and immune response to the antigen used in the development of COVID-19 vaccine is an imperative issue. Based on the advantages of using zebrafish as a model in research, herein we suggest doing this to test the safety of the putative vaccine candidates and to study immune response against the virus. We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish. The specimens generated humoral immunity and passed the antibodies to the eggs. However, they presented adverse reactions and inflammatory responses similar to severe cases of human COVID-19. The analysis of the structure and function of zebrafish and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main human receptor for virus infection, presented remarkable sequence similarities. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis predicted protein-protein interaction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 fragment and the Toll-like receptor pathway. It might help in the choice of future therapeutic pharmaceutical drugs to be studied. Based on the in vivo and in silico results presented here, we propose the zebrafish as a model for translational research into the safety of the vaccine and the immune response of the vertebrate organism to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",1,0.116,0.023,0.86,0.9538

10/19/2020 - The director of the Butantan Institute, Dimas Tadeu Covas, and Governor João Doria announced on Monday (19) that the vaccine against coronavirus under development by the Butantan Institute is the safest in the final phase of testing in the Brazil. Clinical studies with 9 thousand volunteers aged between 18 and 59 years in the country show that only 35% had mild adverse reactions after application, such as pain at the application site or headache. There was no record of serious side effects during testing.

""The first results of clinical studies conducted in Brazil prove that, among all the vaccines tested in the country, Coronavac is the safest, the one with the best and most promising indexes in Brazil. It is, in fact, the most advanced vaccine in this moment "", declared the Governor. ""The Butantan vaccine was the one with the lowest rate of adverse effects and the best results to date,"" added Doria.

The development of the vaccine in Brazil started in July, through a partnership between the biopharmaceutical Sinovac Life Science, based in Beijing, and Butantan. Coronavac is one of the most promising immunizers in the final stages of study worldwide and produced based on technology similar to other vaccines successfully produced by Butantan.

The most common reactions among study participants after the first dose were pain at the application site (19%) and headache (15%). In the second dose, the most common adverse reactions were pain at the application site (19%), headache (10%) and fatigue (4%). Low fever was registered in only 0.1% of the participants and there are no reports of serious adverse reaction to the vaccine so far.

The study in Brazil started on July 21 and foresees the total participation of 13 thousand volunteers, all health professionals who work in the care of patients with COVID-19. They are being monitored by 16 research centers in seven states and the Federal District.

Starting this month, the testing of the immunizing potential against the coronavirus is being extended to elderly volunteers, comorbidities and pregnant women. ""The Butantan vaccine is the safest in terms of side effects. It is the safest vaccine at the moment not only in Brazil, but in the world,"" said Dimas Covas, Director of the Butantan Institute.

>**Methods**: We used direct RNA sequencing to analyse transcript expression from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 genome in human MRC-5 and A549 cell lines that are non-permissive for vector replication alongside the replication permissive cell line, HEK293. In addition, we used quantitative proteomics to study over time the proteome and phosphoproteome of A549 and MRC5 cells infected with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine candidate.

>**Results**: The expected SARS-CoV-2 S coding transcript dominated in all cell lines. We also detected rare S transcripts with aberrant splice patterns or polyadenylation site usage. Adenovirus vector transcripts were almost absent in MRC-5 cells but in A549 cells there was a broader repertoire of adenoviral gene expression at very low levels. Proteomically, in addition to S glycoprotein, we detected multiple adenovirus proteins in A549 cells compared to just one in MRC5 cells.

Vaccine efforts against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic are focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.

Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the spike immunogen with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to published spike ectodomain structures. We also observed novel interactions between the spike trimers allowing formation of higher order spike complexes.

>  
>The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge. Our results underscore the potential use of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL as an adjuvant to achieve protection after single immunization with recombinant protein and inactivated virus vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.",5,0.089,0.023,0.889,0.9821

The answer is: “you’ll be fine.”  For a few vaccines (PPSV23, Tdap), if you get a second dose too soon after the last one, you can get a big inflammatory reaction and have a really sore arm and maybe feel a little sick for a few days.  And then you’ll recover.  For most of them, nothing in particular happens.  If you already had measles and get a measles vaccine, your body will simply react to and destroy the vaccine and generate a bump in antibodies and killer T cells.  When I was in medical school, I got an MMR because I wasn’t sure if I’d had my second dose as a kid.  Later, I learned that I had.  Nothing happened after the vaccine.  

The vertebrate adaptive immune system (antibodies and T cells) evolved under a condition in which an individual would be repeatedly exposed to the same pathogen.  That’s the whole point.  So if you survived smallpox, you could walk through a smallpox ward with complete impunity.  If you had measles as a kid, of course your own kids would eventually get measles, but you would not.

A vaccine is designed to provide something simulating a natural exposure without causing the disease.  If you’re already immune, then the immune system will simply attack the vaccine as if it’s a repeat exposure to the pathogen, destroy the vaccine, and generate a boosted response.

Peter Honig, Senior VP of Global Regulatory Affairs for Pfizer, offered written comments on Oct. 15 prior to the to the October 22, 2020, VRBPAC meeting as requested in the Sept. 30, Federal Register notice, stating:

""It is our position that while ensuring the blinded nature of the study as long as possible, 
Pfizer and BioNTech nevertheless would have an ethical responsibility to inform all study 
participants about the availability of an Emergency Authorized Vaccine, if authorized, and 
the eligibility requirements for such a vaccine. If Pfizer’s vaccine is granted Emergency Use 
Authorization, we would propose to amend our ongoing study to allow cross-over of eligible 
placebo subjects to the active vaccine arm if they wish to do so at any time. The statistical 
considerations and details regarding the appropriate protocol language, informed consent, 
and logistics of this process would need to be carefully developed together with the 
regulatory authority.""

The talk about not issuing an EUA, but something lesser would be a means of keeping placebo subjects in trials as long as possible while still offering the vaccine to high risk groups. If the FDA never issues an EUA, the ethics committees in vaccine trials don't have to unblind and offer the vaccine to all participants.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused one of the severest pandemic around the world. The vaccine development for urgent use became more of an issue during the pandemic. An inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A, inactivated polio, and influenza has been proven to be a reliable approach for immunization for long years. In this pandemic, we produced an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by modification of the oldest but the most experienced method that can be produced quickly and tested easily rather than the recombinant vaccines. Here, we optimized an inactivated virus vaccine which includes the gamma irradiation process for the inactivation as an alternative to classical chemical inactivation methods so that there is no extra purification required. Also, we applied the vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) using the intradermal route in mice which decreased the requirement of a higher concentration of inactivated virus for proper immunization unlike most of the classical inactivated vaccine treatments. Thus, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive viral vaccine. We first determined the efficiency and safety dose (either 1013 or 1014 viral copy per dose) of the OZG-38.61.3 in Balb/c mice. Next, to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the OZG-38.61.3, we immunized human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice and infected them with a dose of infective SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test. We showed that the vaccinated mice showed lowered SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number in oropharyngeal specimens along with humoral and cellular immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2, including the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in Balb/c mice without substantial toxicity. This study encouraged us towards a new promising strategy for inactivated vaccine development (OZG-38.61.3) and the Phase 1 clinical trial for the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,0.104,0.039,0.856,0.961

gaizh1s,2020-10-29,"Abstract

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerge as essential mediators of intercellular communication. DNA vaccines encoding antigens presented on EVs efficiently induce T-cell responses and EV-based vaccines containing the Spike (S) proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are highly immunogenic in mice. Thus, EVs may serve as vaccine platforms against emerging diseases, going beyond traditional strategies, with the antigen displayed identically to the original protein embedded in the viral membrane and presented as such to the immune system. Compared to their viral and pseudotyped counterparts, EV-based vaccines overcome many safety issues including pre-existing immunity against these vectors. Here, we applied our technology in natural EV's engineering, to express the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 embedded in the EVs, which mimic the virus with its fully native spikes. Immunizations with a two component CoVEVax vaccine, comprising DNA vector (DNAS-EV) primes, allowing in situ production of Spike harbouring EVs, and a boost using S-EVs produced in mammalian cells, trigger potent neutralizing and cellular responses in mice, in the absence of any adjuvants. CoVEVax would be the prototype of vaccines, where the sole exchange of the envelope proteins on EVs leads to the generation of new vaccine candidates against emerging viruses.",0,0.073,0.013,0.914,0.891

The pharmaceutical companies Pfizer (USA) Iand Biontech (Germany) announced today that their vaccine BNT162b2 ""has shown efficacy against COVID-19"". This was based on the first interim analysis of efficacy, which was performed on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
Case sharing between vaccinated individuals and those receiving the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of over 90% seven days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the start of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose regimen. As the study progresses, the final percentage of vaccine efficacy may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continues as planned with the collection of additional safety and efficacy data. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.
 
A great day for science
 
""Today is a great day for science and mankind. The first results of our Phase 3 study with the COVID-19 vaccine provide the first evidence that our vaccine is capable of preventing COVID-19,"" said Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO of Pfizer. 
 
Effectively prevent Covid-19
 
""The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine can effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and global collaboration,"" said Professor Ugur Sahin, Biontech co-founder and CEO. ""When we embarked on this journey 10 months ago, it was exactly what we wanted to achieve. Especially today, when we are all in the middle of a second wave and many of us are trapped, we appreciate all the more how important this milestone is on our way to end this pandemic and for all of us to regain a sense of normality. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this important achievement possible"".

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 started on July 27. 43,538 participants participated in the study, of which 38,955 received a second dose of the vaccine candidate by November 8, 2020.

Between October 1st and today there were 2.9M new cases in the US, or about 0.87% of the population, so you would expect about 0.87% of the placebo arm to also be diagnosed. Assuming for example that all of the vaccine arm is protected, you would therefore expect a total of 15,000 * 0.87% = 130 total infections. That's a pretty rough estimate because the vaccine was given out over time, the trial was also in other countries, the vaccine is imperfect, and because the data reported today is probably from last week (for analysis time).

Background The stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)

Methods The study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 µg, 7.5 µg, and 15 µg) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42.

Results A total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFNγ and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-γ and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-γ and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

Conclusion These data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 μg CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were ∼10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-γ and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 μg)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations

Background Virus-like particles (VLP) displaying recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. This candidate vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

Methods This randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 µg/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFNγ, IL-4).

Results 180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also increased IFNγ and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups.

Conclusion CoVLP ± adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03 dose, NtAb titers were ∼10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFNγ and IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75μg+AS03) to further clinical evaluation.",2,0.086,0.033,0.882,0.9943

>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 11, 2020-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that it has completed case accrual for the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 COVE study of mRNA-1273, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

>Moderna has seen a significant increase in the rate of case identification across sites in the last week. As a result, the Company expects the first interim analysis will include **substantially more than 53 cases**, the targeted trigger point for the analysis. The data on these cases is being prepared for submission to the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for analysis and recommendation. Moderna remains blinded to whether these participants received vaccine or placebo.

As I commented on the original thread: it increasingly looks as if the dramatic increase in cases across the US has really sped up the trials based there. Wonder if this will also help J&J to announce results earlier than their previous estimate of January.

For reference, 53 is the pre-defined number of cases required for the first interim analysis; this would suggest the actual number of cases accrued is much closer to 106, the second analysis milestone.

To answer the other burning question many will have, a Moderna spokesperson has separately announced the results will be revealed in ""days"", so almost certainly in the next week or so.",170,0.119,0.0,0.881,0.9778

In contrast to the mock-up approach, the authorisation of these vaccines requires submission of a new, full dossier of information. Companies developing new vaccines therefore need to gather more data than are needed to change the virus strain in a mock-up vaccine. This includes a more complete package of information showing how well the vaccine works when given to human volunteers, and its side effects.

> In the emergency procedure, companies utilise the 'rolling review' process, supplying data on vaccines under development as they become available, rather than waiting until they have collected the full dossier of data. This allows the CHMP to evaluate the data in real time, so that the final vaccine can be approved as quickly as possible.

And also:

> Once enough data has been gathered to show that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its risks, the company is obliged to make a formal application to the European Medicines Agency, so that the vaccine can be authorised for use. The CHMP then carries out an accelerated assessment of the full dossier of information, issuing an opinion after around 70 days. This opinion is transmitted to the European Commission, which is expected to take around 25 to 45 days to issue a decision. The vaccine can then be made available for use.

Take Twinrix a combined Hep A and Hep B vaccine as an example.  Twinrix requires three doses at a minimum of 1 month, then 5 month intervals (scheduled at 0, 1 and 6 months) produced the following efficacy at +28 days:  
Hep A: 93.8%, 98.8% and 99.9%  
Hep B: 30.8%, 78.2% and 98.5%  


The FDA approved a rapid version at 0,7 and 21 days followed by a booster at 12 months.  It was found that this schedule provided equivalent efficacy after three doses to the above schedule after 2, and equivalent overall protection.  

Thus, assuming the boosting behaves similarly for COVID, it appears entirely possible to do a first pass mass vaccination, and then come back and get the second pass later, rather than vaccinating half as many people twice.

As far as I understand these vaccines, they basically consist of RNA that encodes the production of some proteines that are also found in the virus. So basically the vaccine coerces your body to produce parts (key!) of the virus. Your immune system then tackles these parts, learns them and later on responds strongly against that virus.

There is obviously a some stuff that could go wrong here:

1. The RNA could contain a ""bug"", i.e. it could produce something harmful. I cannot quantify this risk. On the one hand there *are* deadly genetic plans (viruses and cancer), on the other hand this particular vaccine is probably much less complex.

2. The reaction to the encoded proteine could be harmful (you could develop an allergy against it). I think that this is unlikely as they would hopefully test that scenario.

3. Your IS might learn to react in the wrong way to the virus. Again, this is something the tests should cover.

I think the danger of long-term damage is quite low. The RNA won't stay very long in your body and once it's gone, the effect is immune memory. So this vaccine *should* be ideal for the current scenario where we cannot wait forever to study the results.",4,0.122,0.111,0.767,0.2709

The COVE study includes more than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65. It also includes more than 5,000 Americans who are under the age of 65 but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease. These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total participants in the Phase 3 COVE study.

It looks like 15k vaccinated and 15k got saline. Then 58% of the total was young/healthy (under 65 with no comorbidities), and  ~25% of each group was healthy 65+ year olds while 17% were 18-65 years old with diabetes (36%; of that 17%), severe obesity (25%), significant cardiac disease (19%), chronic lung disease (18%), or liver disease (2%). Its not clear if these percentages include overlapping comorbidities.

Anyway, that breaks down to 8.7k young/healthy, 3.75k old/healthy, and 2.55k young/comorbid for each group. From above we saw:

> This first interim analysis was based on 95 cases, of which 90 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 5 cases observed in the mRNA-1273 group

> [...]

>  The 95 COVID-19 cases included 15 older adults (ages 65+) and 20 participants identifying as being from diverse communities (including 12 Hispanic or LatinX, 4 Black or African Americans, 3 Asian Americans and 1 multiracial). 

First of all, this makes it sound like there were zero cases in the young/cormobid group, but that isnt made 100% clear. Second of all, they dont tell us if those old/healthy cases were all in the placebo group, or if all 5 of the vaccinated cases were over 65 then the other 10 were placebo, or something in between.

But we can say 10-15 out of 3.75k old/healthy placebo subjects got sick, which is 0.27% - 0.4%. Likewise, 75-80 out of 7.7k young/healthy subjects got sick, which is 0.97% - 1.0%.

Therefore (in placebo group) the young/healthy subjects got infected at a rate 3x the old/healthy and it seems none of the young/comorbid subjects got infected.

So I dont think this tells us much about healthy 65+ year olds and nothing at all about younger people with comorbidites. Definitely says nothing about older people with comorbidities. But, as expected, it does seem to be effective and safe for at least a few months in young/healthy people.

A potential problem is ""as with live-attenuated vaccines, replication-competent alphavirus vectors also pose the threat of viral reactivation""

There's another technique which is a DNA-plasmid based saRNA vaccine which is basically a DNA vaccine used to manufacture the saRNA genetic material within the cell nucleus. The danger of DNA vaccines is host cell integration and modifying human genome.

Further, to combat prion formation, they include modified (foreign) nucleotides but this can lead to further complications as these unnatural nucleoside analogues have been shown to have toxic effects in previous studies.

There's also potential for autoimmune reactions.

People seem to be oversimplifying the mechanisms of mRNA vaccines, yet I think there's a lot of caution still to be had here as the iterative development techniques are novel and not proven.

> How can we know much about the safety profile of these vaccines after such a short time? 

mRNA vaccines have been under investigation for years. No severe adverse effects other than normal flu-shot type myalgia stuff.  The Moderna vaccine was co-developed with Dr. Fauci's group at NAID specifically for a fast response to pandemic coronavirus like SARS or MERS. This virus is called SARS-2 or SARS-CoV-2 because it is 80% similar to the first SARS virus. There has also been toxicity trials in mice, pigs, and other non-human primates.  Between Pfizer and Moderna, nearly 50,000 people have been injected with zero severe adverse safety issues. Could there be long-term issues? Perhaps. But as a society, we have to weight the risks of **thousands of people dying per day** versus waiting a few more **YEARS** on conclusive long-term safety data. Just in this year alone, we're estimated to hit nearly 400k deaths from COVID-19. That's like all deaths from all of the combined wars in the entire U.S. history. At some point it becomes unethical to keep trialing vaccines while the bodies begin to pile up. An independent, non-partisan safety review board will review all data, interview test participants, and assign a safety rating before any FDA approval will be given.

&#x200B;

> And specifically, how do we know that ADE is unlikely? 

ADE is unlikely because convalescent plasma transfers haven't resulted in ADE. At the end of the day, these vaccines are just producing the same exact neutralizing antibodies that naturally recovered patients produce on their own, without having that person go through the severe COVID symptoms. There have been tens of thousands of convalescent plasma transfers with zero reported ADE. As well as zero reported ADE from any vaccine trial (including non-mRNA). In fact, there have been zero reported ADE for any COVID-19 treatment.

gchteai,2020-11-16,"When reporting on things that have a degree of randomness involved, it's common to report a confidence interval (often along with a confidence level). For example: You could say that your research has shown that you're 95% confident that the chance of a coin landing heads up is between 43% and 59%. Here [43%, 59%] is the confidence interval, which is the range of values that you think contains the final outcome with a high degree of confidence.

The point estimate is the ""naïve"" estimate of the outcome. Suppose we flipped the aforementioned coin 100 times and it landed heads up 51 times. We'd say that the point estimate for heads is 51%.

But since there's a random element to the process, we can't say that 51% is the true chance of getting heads. It could be a fair coin that gives a 50/50 chance but we just got to 51% through chance. But it could also be a weighted coin that has a 55% chance of landing heads up.

In general, the confidence interval is more informative than the point estimate. In the context of the vaccine trials, Moderna gave us a point estimate (94.5%) as well as some raw numbers (90 & 5 cases in placebo & vaccine arms), so we could probably compute their confidence intervals.

Pfizer gave us far less information. They only stated ""above 90%"" (as well as a total number of cases, but no split between placebo/vaccine groups). This phrasing could imply that 90% is the lower end of their confidence interval. The point estimate is always higher than the lower end of the confidence interval, so this would place their point estimate somewhere between 90% and 100%.

gcqi3wl,2020-11-18,"Questions posed and ""summary answers"":

*  **How long will the vaccine protection last?** 
   *  Bottom line: Taken together, this study, [several others](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/08/18/encouraging-news-about-coronavirus-immunity) over the past few months, and [this recent work](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/11/11/good-news-on-t-cell-response)  all paint a consistent picture of a strong, normal, lasting immune  response in the great majority of patients. Add in the results we’re  seeing from the two vaccines that have reported interim data so far, and  I think that **the prospects for lasting immunity from vaccination are also very good**.  Remember, the early vaccine data suggested antibody responses at least  as strong as those found in naturally infected cases. There seems (so  far) every reason to think that vaccine-based immunity will be as good  or better than that conferred by actual coronavirus infection. I very  much look forward to more data to shore up this conclusion, but that’s  how it looks to me at the moment. 
*  **How effective are these vaccines? Will they provide total protection or not?** 
   *  Bottom line: the results we have so far indicate that **these vaccines will indeed provide strong protection in the great majority of patients**.  The number of asymptomatic cases among the vaccinated population will  be a harder number to pin down, but I believe that we should be in good  enough shape there as well, based on antibody levels in the primate  studies and what we’re seeing in humans. 
*  **What about coronavirus mutations? Will the virus move out from under the vaccine’s targeting?** 
   *  **Bottom line:** the coronavirus can’t undergo the  wholesale changes that we see with the influenza viruses. And the  mutations we’re seeing so far appear to still be under the umbrella of  the antibody protection we’ll be raising with vaccination, which argues  that it’s difficult to escape it. 
*  **What about efficacy in different groups of people? Where will the vaccines work the best, and where might there be gaps?** 
   *  **Bottom line:** our first look at efficacy in older  patients is very good indeed, and that’s the most significant high-risk  patient subgroup taken care of right off the top. 
*  **How safe are these vaccines? What do we know about side effects?** 
   *  **Bottom line:** immediate safety looks good so far. Rare  side effects and long-term ones are still possible, but based on what  we’ve seen with other vaccines, they do not look to be anywhere at all  significant compared to the pandemic we have in front of us. 
*  **OK, what about the rollout? Who’s getting these things first? When does everyone else get a chance to line up?** 
   *  **Bottom line:** the very first people to get these new  vaccines will almost surely be health care workers, and starting some  time on in December.

This is basically a brand new mechanism of action for a vaccine though. mRNA has been used in a few small cohorts of very sick people (e.g. cancer patients) but nothing more than that until now.

What you're asking, essentially, is if something completely novel and unknown that hasn't shown up so far in this or other trial mRNA vaccines could show up. No honest scientist will tell you that's impossible, but what they will tell you is that there is zero reason to think that's going to happen. There is no reason to think that mRNA vaccines are going to behave in a different way from othervaccines. 

How vaccines work is well understood. Why vaccines cause complications, when they cause complications, is well understood. How the mRNA vaccine itself behaves in the body is well understood and we have years of examples with trial vaccines. 

Short of waiting 70 years until everybody who got trial vaccines dies of natural causes, it's pretty much impossible to fathom how we could be more confident than we will be in the safety of these vaccines by the time they're widely available. 

Be aware that, even if you've resisted it, you've been subject to a barrage of anti-vaxx propaganda over the past two decades that is almost certainly influencing your thinking, whether you like it or not. (It's not making you an anti-vaxxer, but it's raising your level of skepticism on the margins - and skepticism on the margins is exactly what I'm hearing from you in your post.) Also, a lot of people struggle with honest-scientist speak. People want to hear ""that's impossible"" but honest scientists don't say that, they say, ""There's zero evidence for that and zero reason to think it's going to happen, but unexpected things happen.""

Also people are bad at evaluating relative risk. Let's hypothesize that there was some unknown, 1 patient in 100,000 risk of these vaccines creating serious complications. I don't think there is, but you could credibly say, I dunno, that there's a 30% chance of that being the case based on the numbers of people who have received the vaccine so far (that's a wild-ass guess, but I did used to do statistics professionally so it's an educated wild-ass-guess; and if that's the right number today, it'll be a tenth that by mid-January).

Well, what do you compare that risk to? Well, in North Dakota right now, 1 in 1000 people have died from COVID. The number in Lombardy is about 1 in 900. New York City is about 1 in 500.  (That's the population fatality rate, not the infection fatality rate.)  And the risk of serious non-death complications from COVID, even for young people, is much, much higher than 1 in 100,000.

Citation needed. This is a science sub. You can’t just pull numbers out of your ass. Young people (let’s say under 30) have far and away the highest recovery rates, to the point where some states don’t even have a recorded COVID death for very young people. Non-lethal effects of the virus, like lung capacity reduction, are common in pneumonia illnesses and almost always temporary.

This would not be an honest scientist either. Chances might be low, but vaccines have caused unexpected side effects in the past and to assert there is “zero reason” to think a brand new mRNA vaccine might do the same is hyperbole, not science.

gcqw13k,2020-11-18,"Pretty much the order of things as they occur for an mRNA vaccine is as follows:

1. mRNA vaccine (which is mRNA + lipid coat) is injected.

2. Certain cells take up mRNA and produce viral proteins. These viral proteins end of being “presented” by cells to the immune system.

3. Immune cells recognize cells presenting the viral protein.

4. Three things happen simultaneously - antibodies specific to the viral protein are produced by B Cells, new virus-specific B cells are produced that can recognize future virus and produce more antibodies down the line (memory B cells), and virus-specific T cells are produced that can directly target infected cells down the line (memory T cells). These three responses generally encompass the immune activation that is needed to prevent or mitigate viral infection. 

5. The mRNA is degraded by the cells natural machinery after a certain amount of time (24 hours to 10 days). 

Now your immune system is poised as it carries the immune cells and antibodies specific to the virus you are trying to protect against, while any trace of the vaccine itself (mRNA, lipid, etc.) is relatively short lived in the body.

gcrm8m7,2020-11-18,"What defines ""A small amount?""

What defines ""a small amount of time?""

This is *the* important question, and I'm not asking those things rhetorically. This gets to the very heart of how our application of science to the field of medicine works. 

We do not define ""well-understood"" by some arbitrary amount, or some arbitrary period of time. The kind of timelines we need to know if something is well understood or not depends on our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. 10 years could be not enough time, and a month could be more than enough, *depending of our understanding of what is actually happening*. You don't just pick a time frame and say, ""That's how long it takes."" 

mRNA itself is not new - it exists in your cells right now! Every day your body makes more of it, and elsewhere in your body it degrades and is cleaned out of your system - it's the chemical your cells use to tell your ribosomes to create proteins. We know how your body creates it, destroys it, breaks down the byproducts. We know how it behaves in your cells while it's active and readable. 

The difference with an mRNA vaccine and a viral-vector vaccine is that instead of using a live virus to inject mRNA into your cells, we've created an inert vehicle which can do the exact same thing. Once the mRNA reaches the cell, the behavior is *exactly* the same. (Before then, mRNA vaccines are probably safer, since there is some small-but-nonzero risk of a reaction to the carrier virus in viral-vector vaccines). 

(It's actually quite hard to hypothesize a reason why a lipid-encapsulated mRNA vaccine wouldn't be more safe than a viral vector vaccine. The challenges of mRNA vaccines over the past two decades have had nothing to do with the mRNA itself, and everything to do with finding the right way to encapsulate it to make sure it gets to your cells without causing any problems on the way or the mRNA getting broken down.)

And people studied this for years (the early experiments with the technology are over 20 years old) and they saw, hey, look, this ""artificial"" mRNA behaves exactly like the mRNA our body creates every day. The only difference is that instead of getting the cell to produce the proteins it normally produces, it gets them to produce the proteins encoded for in the ""artificial"" mRNA. (I put ""artificial"" in quotes because there's nothing chemically that distinguishes it from natural mRNA. It just encodes a different protein). It breaks down and is cleaned out by the same process. 

So, given that we know all this, given that there are tens of thousands of people at this point who have received these vaccines where the ""artificial"" mRNA has long since been cleaned out of their system, what exactly do you want to wait for? 

As I said in my initial post, above, I can't promise you that something completely unprecedented and unexpected won't happen, because that's not how honest scientists talk about this stuff. What I can say is that we know how mRNA works, and nobody even has a good hypothesis that would suggest a meaningful risk of some sort of significant novel unanticipated problem.",25,0.077,0.044,0.879,0.9248

The concern I hear is that some medicines see serious side effects only years, even decades after they get approved. For example long-term use of proton pump inhibitors could lead to fatal cases of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and upper gastrointestinal cancer. 

I know, it is so completely different than the vaccine, and yet the principle is there. An approved medcine causes stuff no one could possibly prove or not when the drug was approved. I am sure the ppi action was also very ""well understood"" too.

What are the chances such a thing can happen with a mRNA vaccine? Is it the same magnitude than with regular drugs, or - because it is vaccine/mRNA vaccine - the chances are much smaller/greater?",4,0.137,0.083,0.78,0.825
gcrym8e,2020-11-18,"Good question! 

That's a reasonable concern, but not something that scientists are particularly worried about. I'm happy to explain it.

So, for example, with a PPI, you're taking that drug every day. That drug is doing its thing in your system every day. Now sometimes the thing that causes a problem is a byproduct of metabolizing the drug (that is, it gets broken down into toxic compounds, or your body has to work too hard to get rid of it, or it does a tiny, microscopic amount of damage every time you take a pill but over 40 years of a pill a day that damage adds up) and sometimes it's a byproduct of the effect of the drug that we don't understand (you stop metabolic pathway X, and we don't learn until years later that this causes metabolic pathway Y to kick into high gear which creates other problems.)

These are real problems with some drugs.  However they are *extremely* unlikely to happen with an mRNA vaccine, and here's why.

So lets look at those two risks one at a time:  

First:  An mRNA vaccine is delivered twice. Your body breaks down the lipid encapsulation and the mRNA itself, so even if those *were* bad for you (they're not, but even if they were) it'd be like eating an apple seed; you eat an apple seed, you're eating arsenic. Your body can handle small amounts of arsenic. Our bodies process out small amounts of poisons all the time! Your body handles a small amount of chemicals that are bad for you in standard vaccines. The rule of thumb is that ""the dose makes the poison"" and we're talking about tiny amount of things that have shown no direct toxic effect in small doses and there's no ""taking the drug every day"" *ongoing* toxicity here and we know that the chemicals involved are not acutely toxic.

Short-term acute toxicity is easy to spot. Long-term toxicity from repeated low-dose exposure is much, much harder to spot. 

So that's risk one. Risk two? That there's some long term metabolic change in your body that has unintended effects? What about that?

Well, what long term effect does an mRNA vaccine have in your body? It creates these spike proteins, which are gobbled up by antibodies and destroyed, and then your body is left with not spike protein mRNA, no spike proteins, and some antibodies, T-cells, and B-cells that recognize the spike protein. Just like if you had chicken pox as a kid your body has antibodies, t-cells, and b-cells that recognize that virus, or if you had a measles vaccine, you're left with ... etc etc etc. 

In other words, the long term effect is *exactly the same* as the long-term effect of any other vaccine: some new cells in your immune system that we understand completely. Once you're at the point of having antibodies, there's zero difference in your body if your got the antibodies via an mRNA vaccine, viral-vector vaccine, or an inactivated virus vaccine where the antibodies locked onto the spike protein. Everything else has been disposed of.

Again, the necessary caveat: sometimes unanticipated things happen. We can be extremely confident that no weird completely unanticipated thing is going to happen, but that level of certainty never reaches 100%.

Here we assessed the immunogenicity of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine regimens in adult and aged non-human primates (NHP). A second vaccine dose, administered 8 weeks post the first immunization, induced a significant increase in antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses in both adult and aged animals as compared to a single dose. In addition, in one-dose regimens neutralizing antibody responses were maintained for at least 14 weeks, providing an early indication of durable immune responses elicited by Ad26.COV2.S.

gcpy6av,2020-11-18,"According to this preliminary data, it looks like the answer to your question is yes. We don't have enough data yet to definitively make a statement like ""any person who takes the vaccine will be 95% less likely to develop COVID symptoms"".  However based on these early results it looks like any individual who received the vaccine is both less likely to develop COVID symptoms if exposed to the virus and if they are exposed to the virus they would be less likely to have a serve reaction to the virus.  

The more people that are vaccinated, the less able the virus is able to pass from person to person. That lowers new cases of COVID-19 in the general population.

In October of this year, the National Center for Biotechnology Information published a paper titled *Vaccine Efficacy Needed for a COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine to Prevent or Stop an Epidemic as the Sole intervention.*  That study concluded that if a vaccine was 80% effective, 60% of the population would need to take that vaccine in order to stop the epidemic entirely. Those percentages come with two very important caveats. 1. They assume that there are no other preventive measures put in place such as masks or social distancing. 2. They assume the r value of the virus is 2.5. 

In the United States at least, our R value is quite a bit lower than 2.5. As of yesterday, the range was from .9 (Mississippi) to 1.42 (Vermont). 

In short, if the vaccine really is as effective as these numbers suggest, a fairly large percentage of people could refuse to take the vaccine and it would still be highly effective at stopping overall transmission rates.

Combined with existing mitigation techniques and the existing level if protective immunity (which given the trajectory of the next few months will likely be quite a bit higher than right now when widespread rollout occurs. I recall NYC was at 20 to 30% months ago) I would expect this would be a massive blow to transmission rates. But we dont know yet if these vaccines also prevent people from spreading covid.

It might just prevent them  from getting ill, or it might prevent illness + transmission (which would be more like sterilizing immunity vs protective immunity. ) We have to wait and see.

I mean, I love how elegant this testing method is, but I cannot help but wonder if it could be shortened. Like even today, couldn't we have technically shortened this drastically by like 500%-1000% if we conducted some human challenge trials with some fully comprehending and consenting (some might even say heroic) volunteers? E.g. only 1000 such volunteers could be enough. And we would have all the safety and efficacy data within one or two months!

Maybe I am not fully understanding everything that can go wrong, but isn't the worst case that those 1000 fully comprehending and consenting volunteers die a heroic death (unlikely, but we are talking about worst case), while the upside is millions of lives can be saved? I'm not sure how the calculus is not worth it; again, granted that we are talking about fully comprehending and consenting volunteers. 

If you are thinking that no such volunteers would exist, I am not so sure about that. I think there would be quite a few who want to protect others e.g. their family.

Or from another angle: the volunteers knowingly risk a 0.1%-10% chance for death, in order to save millions with 90% chance! I mean, people run into burning houses all the time to try to save others, and the odds are very seldom this much in their favor. Like maybe 50% chance to die themselves, 50% chance to save a few others. This way a single heroic volunteer could literally almost directly be responsible for saving 1000 other lives, with almost full certainty while only putting themselves at 0.1% - 10% chance of dire harm themselves.

(63) links to a preclinical of the Moderna 100-μg vaccine that is getting rolled out to high efficacy these days. So I would be willing to wager that we'll have sterilizing immunity as well, at least to normal-dose viral loads.

This efficacy is based on the first category of ‘I can’t get sick’. 

But something important to note is that even though you don’t feel sick, IE subclincial sickness, you might have gotten the virus and your immune system handles it before you even subjectively notice. But theoretically, especially for this virus where we aren’t sure on the details of incubation period/onset of symptoms etc, you could spread it. 

This isn’t really a huge cause for concern or doubt tho as mass vaccinations mitigate the risk of spread by effectively reducing the infect able population.

>**Background**

>With the unprecedented morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.

>**Methods**

>In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18–59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37·0°C, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process (CellSTACK Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose CoronaVac [3 μg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 μg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608, and is closed to accrual.

>**Findings**

>Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and two (8%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, four (17%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and three (13%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the 3 μg group, 12 (50%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and none (0%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, 19 (79%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and one (4%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33%) of 120 participants in the 3 μg group, 42 (35%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 13 (22%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19%) of 120 in the 3 μg group, 23 (19%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 11 (18%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92%) of 118 participants in the 3 μg group, 117 (98%) of 119 in the 6 μg group, and two (3%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97%) of 117 in the 3 μg group, 118 (100%) of 118 in the 6 μg group, and none (0%) of 59 in the placebo group.

gd4vpsg,2020-11-20,"That's true, and I did a calculation of that but forgot the result. I will do it again now. I live in MD and I just take that as a proxy for the US. In MD there have been 4261 deaths. Of these 3008 are in people 70+, another 1030 are in 50+. About 10% of the population in the US is 70+ and another 20% is 50-70. There are something like 16 million jobs in health care. 

So that is 32 million doses for health care workers.
70 million doses for the very elderly.
140 million doses for the older group.

We have maybe 45 million doses this year in the US. Pfizer and Moderna have promised 1 billion doses roughly in 2021. If that were uniformly distributed you would get 160 million/month ish. So you would have the doses needed by the end of Jan to cover this group. Alas the manufacturing ramp isn't going to be like that. They started the ramp in summer and they only have 50/30 million doses now in ~6 months. Let's say they are at half rate now (just a blind guess), then end of Feb they have the doses needed if it *all* goes to the US. It won't. Half of it might go to the US. So that means 4 months which is April. 

So basically that is what I said before you will see significant changes in April. Not everyone will be willing to be vaccinated. If Oxford/AZ gets approved we will see at least 1/3 more supply maybe 50% more, I expect that to happen which to me means Feb is the date the US has enough to vaccinate 90% of the deaths away. Deaths aren't the only thing that matters and lifting restrictions on people in the 0-50 age range like nothing is going on will still cause lots of deaths.

You are making an assumption that the second dose of a two-dose Covid vaccine needs to be given in a narrow time frame. But most existing two-dose vaccines do not require a narrow time frame for the second dose. For example, the second dose of the Shingrix (herpes zoster) vaccine is recommended to be given two to six months after the first, and further, ""If more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose of Shingrix, you should administer the second dose as soon as possible. *However, you do not need to restart the vaccine series.*""

and from a web site with information on all the common vaccines,

""**Is it necessary to start a vaccine series over if a patient doesn't come back for a dose at the recommended time, even if there's been a year or more delay?** For routinely administered vaccines, *there is no vaccine series that needs to be restarted because of an interval that is longer than recommended*. In certain circumstances, oral typhoid vaccine (which may be given for international travel) needs to be restarted if the vaccine series isn't completed within the recommended time frame.""

Companies can request it to speed up the process, and FDA usually agrees if the drug treats an serious disease where there are no good options already available.

If they find even a slight error in the methodology, there should be a discussion to make sure it really is slight and doesn't affect everything.

And there's _so much_ of methodology. Any problem with recruitment of the subjects? Any problem with the randomization? The behaviour of the different groups? The supply chain of the vaccine to the injection sites? Proper documentation of the subjects' medical histories and the immediate aftermath of the injections?

We've just reached up until the initial injection. Repeat much of that for the second doses. Analysis of anyone who dropped out between doses - they were probably removed from the study altogether, yes, but just in case, ensure it doesn't affect the data? Doing that kind of analysis with each and every ""edge case."" And THEN comes the ""meat"" of the thing.

A failure here could stop people in having faith in these agencies for decades to come. So the stakes are high on the other end, too.

I really really want NovaVax and J & J to complete their phase 3 trials. J&J because it is a single dose and doesn't require extreme freezing. Plus J&J is one of the few pharmas with strong supply chain. Also one of their executives said that they are recruiting upwards of 1000 participants per day, so we might see full enrolment by mid-December.

NovaVax is also one I am rooting for. I have heard from 2 different sources (first one Bill Gates and second one was Dr. Peter Hotez from Texas children hospital), that protein based subunit vaccines are predicted to be one of the most effecient, compartively easy production and logistics.

Also NovaVax has a deal for 2 Billion and more doses for 2021. Apart from that if NovaVax is effacious, we might also get one from Sanofi and GSK which produced insane levels of anitbodies (not sure neutralising or binding).


I am really glad that Moderna and Pfizer have a super efficient vaccine but it is not at all viable for Asia, part of Eastern Europe and whole of African continent.

Also, if the vaccines in the west are rolled out, NovaVax can also run trials in Asia (they have a pact with India's Serum Institute) and South Africa or Brazil.

In India, we also have a whole virion vaccine under phase 3 trial + a DNA plasmid vaccine which will be starting phase 3 too. However its a 3 dose regimen which isn't gonna help much.

gddeggc,2020-11-23,"The correct answer is that we can't get a confidence interval without some prior assumptions that are so large they could effectively decide our answer if we chose.

But I went ahead and did it anyway.  I'll give the answer first:  it's in the pretty graph [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vi8hfsowhb). The 95% confidence interval is shown in the intersection of the red curve with the black lines.  Changing the values of V (vaccine cases) and P (placebo cases) will give a different curve and let you see the confidence intervals there. 

* It has previously been stated that the distribution of cases was 101+30=131, which likely breaks down to 71+27=98 in the full+full dose and 30+3=33 in the half+full dose regimens.

* That gives a confidence interval for 30+3 in the half+full regimen as 66.7%-96.4%.

* With 71+27 in the full+full regimen we get a 39-75% confidence interval.

* And the given point, 101+30 for the full trial, gives a 55-80% confidence interval.

The first trivial assumption we have to make is about the relative sizes of the vaccine and placebo groups.  Assuming they are the same size will suffice, and probably works fine for this trial (however, it is worth noting that one of the Russian trials has a vaccine group 50% bigger than the placebo group, so it's not a given).  We also have to assume they're large enough that the events are independent: that immunity gained from infection doesn't significantly reduce the group size.

The second assumption is far deeper: we need a prior for the expected distribution of vaccine efficacy.  For these calculations, I have simply assumed that this is linear; i.e., that the probability of a 50-51% efficacy is ""the same"" as that of a 99-100% efficacy.  This is probably false, and we could change this distribution to be anything we wanted to give any answer we want.  In hindsight, it's obvious that no interval is possible without this assumption.  And this is, no doubt, why Bayesian math is used (it means in a Bayesian calculation you'd need two priors going in: one for the efficacy and one for the error margin).

To follow the calculations directly, it's probably easier to read the notes in the Desmos graph directly and look at the visualizations as you go through it.  Again, the link is [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vi8hfsowhb).

Because hundreds of thousands of people who survive the virus survive because of an intact healthcare system.

In addition, healthcare workers are exposed to high viral doses due to the nature of their jobs. 

You act like because the vaccines are 90% effective, the other 10% of people spontaneously combust. It's like lol nothing bad is going to happen to the other 10%. It just doesn't do anything.

When you think about it, how can inhaling a pneumophilic aerosolized virus ***not*** reach the lower resp tract?!  (the air-tissue surface area of the lungs is huge!)

I think virus is first in ***lower*** resp tract in most adult->adult transmissions -  symptoms are absent at first, then increase. Once in lungs, virus can replicate and aerosol is generated prior to symptoms. This phase can be highly infectious (probably when most superspreading happens).

To drastically oversimplify, 95% confidence means “out of 100 possible outcomes, 95 of them are in this range of numbers.”  There are magic mathematical tests that use the bell curve “normal distribution” to analyze a set of data and tell you where these windows are for your data.

The more information you have from studies, the more you can tighten that window.  And the more consistent and decisive your information is, the more confidence you can build.

If you sample only a couple people, you’re not going to have enough data to prove anything.  If you sample the whole world, you’ll know for certain!  Reality is somewhere in the middle, and the statistics tell us how trustworthy the numbers are and whether we need more data.

The way the point estimates now stand, the full/full dosage trials might actually stop recruiting and instead recruit more people into the half/full regime. It doesn't look to be inferior to the full/full dosage and is dose sparing so more people can get vaccinated with that regime.

Time changes our perceptions. 

To your comment on whether it's wise or not . . . it's the FDA's job to determine if drugs are safe and effective, full stop. At times, the FDA has ventured into areas where they are making their decisions based on whether a drug adds to the landscape of other approved drugs, but that technically isn't their mandate. Just because the FDA approves a drug, that doesn't mean anyone has to use it. If the decision is made that the only approved regimen is 62% effective, doctors (personal physicians as well as doctors who work for government and other entities) will make their decision on whether anyone will actually receive it. 

If the AZ drug meets the FDA guidelines, they should approve the drug. Not doing so would be a very high-profile case of going outside their mandate. When we have all the data, doctors will be able to judge whether they want to use it and in who and at what dose.",2,0.125,0.007,0.868,0.9756
gdlonnp,2020-11-24,"I hear what you're saying and it's a valid perspective.  But if data shows there's a chance that a particular vaccine is only 30% effective, that would be really marginal for a mass immunization program.  My understanding was the announced 50% threshold was a minimum required for a vaccine to be considered at all, not an automatic approval level (although I'm by no means an expert on FDA approvals.)

The safety and efficacy bar can and should be higher for vaccines that are broadly recommended for mass administration throughout the community;  this isn't like a treatment that a doctor may choose to deploy in a patient where nothing else has worked where even a 30% success rate could be life changing.  

We probably only get one shot at immunizing each person for a variety of reasons (cost, compliance, etc.), and the FDA has an obligation to the nation to get the recommendations right - once approval occurs, most people will receive a vaccination straight from Walgreens or CVS, and a nuanced conversation with their physician about choosing the best product will rarely be part of the process.

I do think that AZ's vaccine will likely be approved, but I think the data they've announced so far implies a much more careful analysis would be prudent rather than the fast-track process that Pfizer and Moderna appear bound for.",2,0.139,0.034,0.827,0.982
gdn3eb5,2020-11-24,"The guidelines were set up so that the companies would know what they needed for approval. There is no such a thing as ""automatic approval"" by the FDA, it's always a crazy amount of data changing hands. 

It has been widely believed - and often discussed on this forum - that it was likely that some vaccines would end up being targeted toward certain people. It seemed likely that a vaccine would be better for older people, for whom stimulating their immune systems can be more difficult. Maybe there would be a gender difference or race would be a factor in the efficacy. When you expect that a vaccine might have 60-70% efficacy, which was the going assumption just a few weeks ago, it is likely that those differences exist. No one would have been surprised if the FDA gave approval for a number of vaccines, but put wording in their label that ended up targeting certain demographic groups. Up until Pfizer / BioNTech released their data, this was considered likely. 

When two vaccines release preliminary data with a 95% efficacy estimate, all the thinking changes because it's pretty HAS to work in all the bigger sub-groups. From a math perspective, it's MUCH more difficult to get to a 95% efficacy and not work well in seniors, or Latinos, or one gender or the other. If a vaccine with 95% efficacy doesn't work in a certain sub-group, there weren't many of them in the trial (e.g. Native Americans). When you report 62% efficacy, it's almost likely that it works in some sub-groups and not in others. 

If you notice, the Pfizer press release made a very bold statement on sub-groups: ""Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%."" The Astrazeneca press release didn't speak to sub-group analysis; the closest they came was, ""The global trials are evaluating participants aged 18 years or over from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions."" No claim that their efficacy was similar across different demographics or even that they met some minimum standard in all sub-groups evaluated. 

If there isn't enough data to approve the alternate dosing regimen (half dose / full dose), it's likely that the primary dosing regimen (full dose / full dose) worked (at a 50%+ point estimate with the CI not including 30%) in some sub-groups and not in others. The FDA should give approval for use in those sub-groups. 

I get what you're saying about patients not having a nuanced conversation with their doctor or pharmacist about the their choice of brand. But remember what I said earlier about certain vaccines being targeted toward certain people and how that was our going assumption just a few weeks ago. It's always been assumed that the decision would be made guided by other actors. Insurance companies aren't going to pay for a vaccine that isn't recommended for a particular patient just like they won't pay for a drug that's not recommended for a particular patient. Chain pharmacies are going to set up protocols as to who will receive which vaccine. States are going to play a role in who gets which vaccines for Medicaid patients. Operation Warp Speed has the right to buy 300 million doses of the AZ drug, but that doesn't mean they have to.

gdgjbgf,2020-11-24,"There are a few reasons.

Growing the virus to kill off for deactivated vaccines is one reason. Cell culture adaptations have to be kept in check and yields can be less than stellar. It takes time as well to grow sufficient material for enough doses.

The deactivation process can screw up the protein structure too much, resulting in less than stellar performance of the vaccine or in some cases making things worse.

The surface proteins can sometimes carry self-like antigens (mimicry) to reduce detection by the immune system. This has the chance to propagate the same auto-immune conditions that the virus can cause (H1N1 GBS and narcolepsy for example).

&#x200B;

Viral vectors, protein subunits and mRNA (and pDNA) get around those limitations. With growing a viral vector you're not all that concerned about cell culture adaptations as long as it can still get inside human cells. You can remove genes responsible for replication in human cells. With mRNA there is no cell culture at all, just pDNA templates and a PCR machine. With protein subunits you need cells but they can be just about anything that can produce the desired protein structure you want. All these approaches simply give much better control over what you're actually going to inject into a person. The added benefit to viral vectors and nucleic acid types is that you get the antigens expressing inside the cells - that's the only way you can get cytotoxic cell responses (CD8+). Neither protein or killed virus vaccines can do that.

Edit: *missed the question about attenuated. They are being worked on, at least one in South Korea with very decent pre-clinical results.

Patent exclusivity during a pandemic is awful, and if it's enforced, will be due to corporate interests + maintaining the influence of countries in the global north. Especially as it's not like countries like the US haven't temporarily restricted patent exclusivity within its own borders during crises - post 9/11 anthrax being a good example (when they ignored Bayer's patent). Yet you'll see bloomberg and the WSJ put out articles about how it's a 'troubling' sign and shouldn't be done in the context of the pandemic for 'reasons'

The rhetoric of (and I'll quote from a WSJ article here 'cus it demonstrates what I'm talking about clearly)

> It’s not clear developing countries even have the ability to manufacture large-scale, complex technologies like Moderna’s mRNA vaccine or Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody cocktail—let alone distribute them

is exceptionally problematic + very inaccurate. We've seen this sort of rhetoric thrown around pretty frequently, and it's usually wrong. Like GSK had used the same rhetoric in the 1980s after it developed recombinant vaccines when Indian researchers had approached them for technology transfer - effectively that India couldn't afford them and even if they could, they weren't skilled enough to make it work. 

The end result of that was Shantha, an Indian company, developing its own vaccine without help at a far cheaper rate - UNICEF then ended up using that vaccine for things like Hep-B because it was so cheap. Shantha then got bought by Sanofi. 

Same thing happened with Tamiflu during the bird flu crisis in the mid 2000s (albeit Tamiflu wasn't actually effective) - Gilead said companies in the global south wouldn't be able to produce generics 'cus it was too hard - companies ended up producing them within 3 months. 

Gilead did the same thing during Covid for remdesivir, and generics were ready by the middle of the year.

The rhetoric is unhelpful, it ends up costing a lot of lives, and it's aimed at strategic, non-public health related goals (it wouldn't matter as much if it was just rhetoric, problem is that they act on these things). The vast majority of countries won't mess around with vaccines because of the consequences. There's a reason almost all African countries have COVID under control relative to Western Europe/the US - it's because they know the stakes and that their healthcare systems won't be able to handle it.

If you could imagine, hypothetically a Brazilian demographic that could have pre-trial anti-chadox antibodies in say 30% of the cohort; as opposed to 18% measured in the UK p1/p2 study , then the theory of the initial vaccine high dose more strongly compromising the next, in those groups could perhaps make some more sense.  but as to why Brazil could have higher antibodies to chimp adenovirus vector

> **The unexpected occurrence of NAb to simian Ad among Brazilian adults at rates higher than previously reported in the US or Thailand gave rise to the hypothesis that chimpanzee adenoviruses may circulate among monkeys from Brazil**

 suppose we could easily validate if there's any truth to this if results of the ChAdOx1-specific neutralizing antibody assay results are publicized from Brazil participants, but in any case would seem like the higher country specific chadox antibodies theory would begin self correcting somewhat when data from elsewhere like US comes in -- Neutralizing antibodies against AdC have been reported to occur in much lower prevalence rates in North America (2–4%)

we see from comparisons of US and Brazil,  seroprevalence of NaBs to two select other chimpanzee adenovirus in Brazil was more than 10 fold higher than what was documented in US. That is surprising.

Abstract

There is an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to control the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent COVID-19. Here, we report the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) produced from the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with NVX-CoV2373 and the saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant induced anti-S antibody that was neutralizing and blocked binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Following intranasal and intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized macaques were protected against upper and lower infection and pulmonary disease. These results support ongoing phase 1/2 clinical studies of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2327 vaccine (NCT04368988).",19,0.109,0.041,0.85,0.8591

gdsm75g,2020-11-26,"Excellent! I think this is the first time we have seen truly sterilizing immunity in a SARS-CoV-2 animal vaccine trial. It's easy to spot the reason as this vaccine induces a ridicolously high neutralization titer: 17,920–23,040, which is ten or more times higher than anything we've seen either with the wild infection or vaccine candidates. 

It was [previously estimated](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.383323v1.full.pdf) that a titer of 3,400 nAbs was sufficient to provide sterilizing immunity against high-dose viral challenge in primates. This vaccine hits well above that mark. The virus basically is bounced off its host. 

Now, to be honest we don't know a lot of things about how human SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will pan out. As far as we know, besides avoiding the disease, even if they don't fully prevent asymptomatic infection and replication, they might still hamper such processes enough that herd immunity kicks in and the virus transmission is curtailed. 

However, it might also turn out that folks vaccinated with the other early vaccines can be infected and can transmit the virus, even if the vast majority doesn't show any symptom nor suffer any pathology. In that unlucky case, this Novavax vaccine - or at least, this concept of vaccine - is the one we should switch to for maintenance and eradication of SARS-CoV-2.",6,0.085,0.03,0.885,0.9091

Those are some harsh words.

Initially the news reported this as a dosing error, however someone shared an interview of Prof. Adrian Hill on youtube (channel - GV ^*, video title ""Vaccitech Co-Founder Professor Adrian Hill on Developing a Covid-19 Vaccine"" , time stamp \~21 min 35 sec) where he said (am paraphrasing) - during the initial stage some of their manufacturing batches from different centers  failed in the early months & they were supply constrained. They compared the half-prime dose with the full-prime dose wherein the immunogenicity looked the same. So they carried on till supply was good enough to go with full-prime dose.

>  Ax/Ox is dead at least when it comes to the US. 

AZ still has multiple pathways, for US FDA EUA:


* They can still apply with ""full prime-full boost dosage"" , even if they are forced to remove the "" half prime - full boost dosage "" cohort . They probably won't like the 60% efficacy tag - given we have two vaccines with \~90% efficacy on verge of authorisation.
* They can wait for the results of their US trial to come up (shouldn't be long since the pandemic is raging in the US) . It is important to remember their UK arm did weekly swabs and tested people for asymptomatic infections. So their 60% efficacy number is not directly comparable to Pfizer / Moderna's 90% efficacy numbers. The US arm however uses a similar method, symptomatics are tested and confirmed. The efficacy readout here could be very different depending on the vaccine's ability to prevent asymptomatic infections.
* They could do a non-inferiority comparison trial against Pfizer/Moderna if FDA has accepted them by the time they launch their trial (Just need to prove 80-85% efficacy)
* And finally, the approach indicated by their CEO in interviews i.e of another international trial (this could be same as a non-inferiority trial if they design it so) . He is confident that given the indications of high efficacy it shouldn't take much time.

I’m certainly open to being persuaded by data. For example, if they have MRIs showing evidence of earlier disease activity in both patients.

ge5sa8z,2020-11-30,"I mean, in terms of severe disease it seems like there are four scenarios, going from worst to best for any vaccine.

1. The vaccine causes some kind of immune super-response that makes severe disease more likely even as it protects most people (i.e. your chance of severe disease increases when vaccinated).
2. The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).
3. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease but the percentage of people among those who get sick who go on to get severe disease is the same (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 94 percent)
4. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease AND the remaining six percent are still less likely to get severe disease (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 98 percent). 

It seems like the Moderna data points to 3 or 4 but there aren't enough cases yet to know yet which one. Severe disease is still uncommon enough and the vaccine is overall effective enough that we don't know if it's further limiting severe disease beyond its extremely high regular efficacy.

Interestingly, the Oxford vaccine, which had a much higher number of vaccinated people with symptoms, still had no severe disease.  We saw something like this in the first NHP studies of the Oxford vaccine, where the upper airways were infected but the lungs were protected.

That's why trials take so long.. I presume they will be monitoring/reporting new results for at least a few more weeks.
They did report some earlier data a couple of weeks ago with roughly the same ratios... The fact that stats has become better after two weeks partially answers your question (mild covid become severe covid within a week)..

This is the pure, unadulterated power of randomization. You randomize the two groups properly (which...any decent trial will do, let alone one like this), you simultaneously solve every one of those problems and all other conceivable problems. It's pretty much the backbone of the statistics that lets all this work so well, and this is also why randomized drug trials are considered much stronger than observational ones.

If it's due to the false negative rate, then as I said the randomization means the same thing should've occurred in the control group too - which it didn't. And if it's the first one happening only in the vaccine group, _caused_ by the vaccine, that's still fine - that means you'll only develop very mild covid and not be serious.

ge9xk0m,2020-11-30,"The antibody studies were effectively studies of convenience, drawing from blood donors and/or HCWs, whoever was easily accessible - they specifically were not randomized properly, and they were criticised for this repeatedly. To randomize them, you would need to collect blood samples from volunteers, which would take a very long time for something which is effectively a one-off blood draw (unlike a treatment or vaccine trial) - it doesn't make sense to put that much effort if you can simulate results from a semi-random draw. Though better seroprevalence studies have been done, but anyway.

Large, decently conducted medical trials are rarely that. A drug trial or a vaccine trial will practically _always_ be properly randomized. Now it's certainly within the realms of possibility that they screwed up - and this will be noticed either in peer review, or by the FDA/EMA/etc during approval - this is one of the things they test for. But in general, it's a _completely_ different kind of study than the antibody studies - them randomizing poorly would be completely shocking and ruin the reputations of everyone involved completely.

> . Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread.

1) The primary aim of the vaccines is to prevent severe infection and deaths. This is obviously where they'll have the strongest data; the other data is still promising but less strong, and it's impossible for it to be strong without testing every participant ever weak (which apparently Oxford did in the UK, but won't be doing in the US.) Therefore, even if the vaccine reduced symptoms and did nothing else, they've already done what they want to. But on top of that, participants have to keep weekly medical diaries and get tested - missing mild cases is again unlikely under these conditions.

2) That statement is just misleading at best; the long term complications of covid have been shown to be heavily correlated to the severity of infection. And no, _presymptomatic_ spread is the major threat; those who are completely asymptomatic spread it very very little compared to presymptomatic or those with symptoms [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jz87nd/what_the_data_say_about_asymptomatic_covid/). On top of that, studies in fact show that those with more symptoms are likely to spread more.

So, that's the bottom line - until and unless someone _actually_ finds a flaw in the randomization, which would be extremely unlikely, it's quite unreasonable to think it's not. But you're perfectly free to wait for a peer review or the FDA to confirm it - nobody's getting injected before that. And EVEN IF despite all the protocols it's missing tons of mild cases (and remember, the medical diaries) - then you still succeeded in your primary aim of stopping severe infections and thus hospitalizations and deaths, therefore turning covid into simply another circulating coronavirus.

ge7jc9o,2020-11-30,"What matters now is not when the trial reads out as much. It is efficacy and manufacturing/scaling.

The mRNA vaccines are going to cover the super high risk groups by the end of winter.

In the US something like 22 million people will be vaccinated by mid-Jan; if there are no logistical issues. That's enough to cover every single person in heath care and long term care facilities. There are other ways to slice it but by March I would fully expect that everyone 70+ and in heath care will have been offered an mRNA vaccine. 

If the trial starts today, and enrolls everyone on day 1, they won't have 2 months of safety data post second dose until the end of Feb. That isn't going to happen so best case is March. By then, the mRNA vaccines will be working down into the 50-70 cohort I think in the US. Remember the US has pre-orders of 100 million on each so 100 million people total should get them early (due to 2 doses). That's almost enough to cover the 50-70 group. 

None of this puts out the pandemic in the west though. Because 100 million people is less than 1/3 of the population in the US. We can assume the EU and others will be similar. Canada will have to wait longer because they have no vaccine production at all. NZ won't see any vaccines for even longer because they have no serious local transmission, etc.

So the mRNA vaccines will pull down the death and hospitalization rates. That leaves achieving herd immunity: that's a task of vaccinating 257 million people in the US for a 95% vaccine or pretty much everyone for a 70% vaccine. To put an end to the epidemic what matters is when the last person is vaccinated not the first.

**Thus, what matters is how the manufacturing goes not when efficacy is shown. Sure you have to show efficacy and safety but the name of the game now is manufacturing and logistics.** 

On this front the Novavax trial start date has slipped twice. Hopefully that is just a bump before the pipeline opens as they point this to being commercial scale production in the press release.

ge5g4gr,2020-11-30,"Well, I agree if you are saying that vaccine makers might attempt to push things through that would normally not meet the quality bar. I think I'm skeptical of this for a couple of reasons:
-vaccine makers have a process too
-vaccine makers brand does matter
-the bayesian priors are so in their favor that maybe it would be good for them to be more risky

The bar is actually better than 33%, as many vaccine trials fail for issues like enrollment, or the disease dies out (ebola). The efficacy rate in phase 3 trials is 85%.

For example, let's say that a vaccine maker instead of pushing something 85% likely to work pushed through pushed through something 40% likely to work. And for safety, let's assume it's known to be 2x worse than the worst vaccine ever, so maybe 1 in 10,000 get narcolepsy. But they still push it through. 

This implies taking the untested vaccine has a 40% chance of protecting you and 0.1% chance of serious side effect.

For the elderly, who at the beginning of the pandemic has a conservative IFR of >10% and let's assume a 10% chance of getting it. Not taking the vaccine has something like a 1% chance of death.

Taking the untested vaccine would I'm this example would reduce your chance of death by 0.6% but increase the chance of serious disease by 0.1%. for most people, this should be an obvious decision to vaccinate, even using the most pessimistic adaptions possible. The bayesian priors on this suggest we should be in aggregate approving vaccines dramatically faster in a pandemic. Days, maybe weeks.

This is much more conservative than people who actually conduct phase 1 trials. 

Removing a ban on a vaccine doesn't mean that we don't do science, it means we take smart risks and watch the data and reassess. You can always ban something that after x doses proves it doesn't make sense.

I don't know if this is your stance, so I don't want to put words in your mouth, but the FDA has taken the stance that it should ban people from taking a vaccine that is expected to be most likely safe and effective, in order to prevent the low chance that it might do worse. This is a widespread issue in medicine (including the hippocratic oath).

I am saying this stance makes no sense and we need to find a way to change it. If a vaccine in a pandemic has overwhelming positive expected value, people should not be barred from doing that.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused COVID-19 disease in China. So far, no vaccine has licensed to protect against infection with COVID-19, therefore an effective COVID-19 vaccine needed. The aim of this study was to predict antigenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 for designing the COVID-19 vaccine using immunoinformatic analysis. In this study, T and B-cell epitopes of S protein were predicted and screened based on the antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cross-reactivity with human proteomes. The epitopes were joined by the appropriate linker. LT-IIc as an adjuvant was attached to the end of the structure. The secondary and 3D structure of the vaccine was predicted. The refinement process was performed to improve the quality of the 3D model structure; the validation process is performed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA z-score. The proposed vaccine's binding affinity to the HLA-A11:01 and HLA-DRB1_01:01 molecule was evaluated by molecular docking. Using molecular dynamics, the stability of vaccine-HLA complexes was also evaluated. Finally, in silico gene cloning was performed in the pET30a (+) vector.

The issue really will be if they can get to their endpoints quick enough to enter the market. Pfizer, Oxford, and Moderna had the advantage of running their phase three trials in a rapidly expanding outbreak in the US, so they were able to hit their interim readouts and even exceed the numbers they hoped for (of infections in both trial arms).

section 5 (pages 7-8) has some summary on efficacy.

Efficacy against COVID-19 disease

At the time of the analysis of Study 2, information presented is based on participants 16 years and older. Participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 disease for at least 2,214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and at least 2,222 person-years in the placebo group. There were 8 confirmed COVID-19 cases identified in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 162 cases in the placebo group, respectively. In this analysis, compared to placebo, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 from first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 in participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 95.0% (95% credible interval of 90.3% to 97.6%). In participants 65 years of age and older and 75 years of age and older without evidence of prior infections with SARS-CoV-2, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was 94.7% (two-sided 95% confidence interval of 66.7% to 99.9%) and 100% (two-sided 95% confidence interval of -13.1% to 100.0%) respectively.

In a separate analysis, compared to placebo, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine from first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 in participants with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 94.6% (95% credible interval of 89.9% to 97.3%).

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 disease including those with one or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (e.g. asthma, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).",3,0.05,0.041,0.909,0.5576

1. Long term effects with modern vaccination has not been much of a thing, the only ones I'm aware of there were a couple of issues that may or may not be linked to H1N1 vaccines, namely a type of nerve problem called GBS and a type of sleep disorder called narcolepsy, but if the vaccine did trigger them, they manifest within 2-3 months, max. The ""effects years down the road"" has never been observed, despite a lot of monitoring.

2. Both mRNA vaccine and vector spike vaccines are believed to be safer than traditional vaccines, because they only deliver the Covid signature spike and not the whole dead virus like the H1N1 flu vaccines (The flu vaccine might possibly to trigger GBS/narcolepsy because the flu itself is able to trigger GBS/narcolepsy, and the vaccine is supposed to mimic an infection, and some times the immune system over-reacts). Because the spike vaccines are a lot more targeted, they are much less likely to over-stimulate the immune system and cause neurological issues.

Then the spikes that are floating around in the body are attacked by the immune system, antibodies are developed, and all of the spikes are destroyed.

> Im just not sure what the possible latent or dormant effects would even be that would pop up years down the road.

Look up antibody dependent enhancement. Basically if you have weak antibodies towards the spike protein it lets the virus infect your immune cells. This can happen after waning, if you have chronic illnesses (eg, in old age) and thus weak immune response, or if a new strain comes out with slightly different epitope so the antibodies bind only partially to it. Or any combination of the above.

Actually, the longest lasting covid antibodies seem to be vs S2 subunit of the spike protein.

One of the infections, altered by BCG vaccination, may be COVID-19. The pathogenesis of the development of acute interstitial pneumonia/respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19 is characterized by the triggering of excessive systemic action of inflammatory mediators, in particular, cytokines, due to violation of the focal inflammatory barriers. Gamma-interferon, produced by lymphocytes after BCG vaccination, modulates the activity of a number of interleukins, which in turn may attenuate course of COVID-19 by reducing the activity of IL-12 and IL-18 -dependent reactions. There is an antigenic cross-reaction between the peptides from causative agents of mycobacterioses and SARS-CoV2 because of their proteins’ homology. Unlike many adjuvants, BCG decreases the incidence of lymphoid malignancies and its effect on various autoimmunopathies is different, not necessarily harmful.

**Background**

As part of the accelerated development of prophylactic vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) we report a first-in-human dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a novel protein subunit vaccine candidate composed of a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein produced in CHO-cells, combined with two different adjuvants.

**Methods**

This phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18 to 54 and 55 to 75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 µg, 9 µg or 30 µg SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining.

**Findings**

We report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults. Titres were higher than those observed in a panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera in all AS03 groups and high dose CpG/Alum groups. Both adjuvanted formulations elicited Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses.

**Interpretation**

SCB-2019 trimeric protein formulated with AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.",9,0.053,0.024,0.923,0.872

>**Summary**

>**Background**

>A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials.

>**Methods**

>This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5×10¹⁰ viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK
trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid
amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1−relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674.

>**Findings**

>Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11636 participants (7548 in the UK,
4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard
doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1% (95% CI 41·0–75·7; 27 [0·6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs 71 [1·6%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90·0% (67·4–97·0; three [0·2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2%] of 1374; pinteraction=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70·4% (95·8% CI 54·8–80·6; 30 [0·5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death. There were 74341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, IQR 1·3–4·8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.

“The timing of priming and booster vaccine admin- istration varied between studies. As protocol amendments to add a booster dose took place when the trials were underway, and owing to the time taken to manufacture and release a new batch of vaccine, doses could not be administered at a 4-week interval. 1459 (53·2%) of 2741 participants in COV002 in the LD/SD group received a second dose at least 12 weeks after the first (median 84 days, IQR 77—91) and only 22 (0·8%) received a second dose within 8 weeks of the first. The median interval between doses for the SD/SD group in COV002 was 69 days (50–86). Conversely, the majority of participants in COV003 in the SD/SD group (2493 [61·0%] of 4088) received a second dose within 6 weeks of the first (median 36 days, 32–58; appendix 1 p 11)”

gf3xqwt,2020-12-08,"fficacy of 90·0% seen in those who received a low dose as prime in the UK was intriguingly high compared with the other findings in the study. Although there is a possibility that chance might play a part in such divergent results, a similar contrast in efficacy between the LD/SD and SD/SD recipients with asymptomatic infections provides support for the observation (58·9% [95% CI 1·0 to 82·9] vs 3·8% [−72·4 to 46·3]). Exploratory subgroup analyses, included at the request of reviewers and editors, that were restricted to participants aged 18–55 years, or aligned (>8 weeks) intervals between doses, showed similar findings. Use of a low dose for priming could provide substantially more vaccine for distribution at a time of constrained supply, and these data imply that this would not compromise protection. While a vaccine that could prevent COVID-19 would have a substantial public health benefit, prevention of asymptomatic infection could reduce viral transmission and protect those with underlying health conditions who do not respond to vaccination, those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, and those who will not or cannot access a vaccine, providing wider benefit for society. However, the wide CIs around our estimates show that further data are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, which will be done in future analyses of the data accruing in these ongoing trials.

These confidence intervals are honestly worse than I feared, and I'm not an optimist. Yes, the lower end of the overall interval is *barely* over the 50% required by FDA for approval, but only barely, but the full-dose regimen actually falls below that, and since we don't really know why the two regimens appear to differ so much in efficacy yet, I am rather skeptical at this stage... I mean, the portion who received the ""better"" regimen, which happened fortuitously in the first place (""The  18–55-year-old  cohorts  were  originally  planned  as  single-dose  efficacy  cohorts""), was restricted to people ""aged 18–55 years"" and was a much smaller subset than the other cohort, so that to obtain ""decent"" values for this one study, they had to go to some lengths:

> Age  and  the  time  difference  between  vaccines  were  therefore   potential   confounders   and   were   explored   further  in  subgroup  analyses,  restricted  to  those  aged  18–55  years,  those  with  more  than  8  weeks’  interval  between vaccine doses, and a comparison of those in the SD/SD  cohort  receiving  vaccines  at  short  (<6  weeks)  or  long  (≥6  weeks)  intervals

Ultimately, they had decided they'd another trial, as we know. If another trial is deemed needed to assess things satisfactorily, then no matter what this interim study says, I don't see why this vaccine should be considered adequate until the actual results from this latest trial are available.

What this means is in terms of qPCR measurement vs spectro measurement, qPCR was evaluated to be more accurate.

The value read as 5 X 10^10 particles by spectro was essentially equal to 2.2 X 10^10 as measured by qPCR.

Apparently Oxford had run phase 1 based on spectro measured doses, so they continued with doses as measured by spectro. This however resulted in unexpectedly lower reactions. After working things out they decided that qPCR was the accurate measure & worked with their manufacturing partners to ensure all doses were then matched to the qPCR value.

1-(1/R0) is just an approximation-- a pessimistic one-- assuming equal susceptibility, uniform contact networks, etc.  Herd immunity threshold could really be as low as, say, 25%.

Second, the efficacy number here cannot be directly compared to the immunity threshold, because we're looking at somewhat different things numerically.

Third, even if we can only tamp down Rt with normal behavior to, say, 1.1--- that's a whole lot more controllable with testing and contact tracing.  The risk of healthcare system overload is mostly eliminated.

Fourth, something we don't know either way is whether people with the vaccine are less likely to spread COVID.  If severity is reduced, it's quite possible for secondary cases to be less likely.  Note that we don't know, either, for the high efficacy vaccines about how well they really prevent *spread* rather than preventing *symptoms*, which is another reason these efficacy numbers cannot be compared to a herd immunity threshold.

Fifth, we're going to be lucky enough to have multiple vaccine choices.  If for logistics reasons or manufacturing reasons, we end up giving some doses of a less effective vaccine--- every dose given of it still lowers caseload and (presumably) pushes us closer to herd immunity.

So might as well go for low-high, especially in view of other considerations in favor of that (more people can be vaccinated sooner, presumably with less side effects).

As for comparison of their 70% to Pfizer’s and Moderna’s alleged 95%: is it actually possible to make a fair comparison at this point?

Duration is an obvious one as immunity may well wane over time. But the second one is important too: for example if a vaccine blocks severe but not light covid, if a trial takes place in circumstances in which only significantly symptomatic cases are likely to be tested, this would lead to a higher apparent efficacy than in
circumstances in which testing is a routine part of life, symptoms or not.

gf7i4ts,2020-12-08,"I was only using the CIs as a simple proxy for making the elementary point that statistical error bars matter, and all the more if you are allowing researchers to single out favorable subsets from their data that were not planned to be separated out in the original study design, in a high-stakes situation in which identifying a subset with markedly better results can make night and day difference in public perception, where “public” here = 8 billion people casting judgment based on a preliminary efficacy estimate mindlessly presented by media as if it is a measurement accurate to 0.1% precision (cf. “Moderna vaccine is 94.1% effective!” headline in New York Times).

Obviously, overlapping 95% CIs is not the same as having no statistical significant difference, but it does flag caution is warranted, especially in view of the above considerations. 

You can have your statistical software run arbitrarily fancy statistical recipes, but nothing can change the fact that in the end all you are doing is plain Bayesian inference. It can only tell you to what extent the new information provided by the data *changes* the probability of a hypothesis being true *relative* to the *prior* probability of it being true before you were informed of the data. 

For example if your 10-year old cousin Vinny flips a coin five times in front of your eyes, and each time gets heads, what do you conclude? There are basically two possibilities: (A) the coin was a fake with heads on both sides, (B) the coin was an ordinary coin and it was just sheer coincidence. No matter how many Fisher tests or Poisson regressions you throw at it, the only thing you can conclude from the data presented to you is that the odds ratio p(B)/p(A) went down by a factor of 1/32 ~ 0.03 relative to the prior odds ratio before cousin Vinny’s demo. But what you conclude from this *strongly* depends on the prior. If the coin came out of a bunch of coins you had in your own wallet and you handed it to your cousin Vinny, you’d probably conclude it was sheer coincidence. If on the other hand your cousin Vinny just got a kiddo magician box from Santa and is insisting on showing you some tricks, and the coin came with the box, you’d conclude the coin most likely just had heads on both sides. 

Moral of the story is: my main mistake was not so much a sloppy eyeballing of overlapping 95% CI error bars instead of turning to the Gospel According To Fisher, but, as pointed out by others, my getting the prior wrong: I mistakenly thought there was no plausible mechanism for low-high to work better. Kind of like scenario 1 with cousin Vinny, failing to realize Vinny could easily have exchanged my coin with a fake coin without me noticing. 

Be that as it may, moral 2 of the story is: if the fate of 8 billion people depends on figuring out whether Vinny’s coin is special or not, it would be prudent to ask Vinny to flip the coin 15 more times.

gfacfny,2020-12-10,"The Oxford and AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine prevented some asymptomatic covid-19 infections in phase III trials, but the effect was mainly seen in the group who received a half dose first, followed by a full dose, the peer reviewed efficacy results have shown.1

The study, published in the Lancet, found that vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic transmission was 59% in the group that received a half dose followed by a standard dose (seven cases among 1120 participants versus 17 cases among 1127 participants in the control group), but just 4% in the group that received two standard doses (22 among 2168 participants versus 23 among 2223 for the control). The researchers said, however, that as this was a secondary outcome, additional confirmation was still required.

Analysis of the primary outcome—efficacy against symptomatic cases of covid-19—showed that the vaccine was 62.1% effective in participants who received two standard doses (n=4440) and 90% effective in those who received a low dose followed by a standard dose (n=1120). This analysis was based on 131 symptomatic cases, of which 30 were in the vaccine arm (27 in the two full doses group, three in the low dose group) and 101 in the control group.

Between April and November 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled to the trial. Half of the participants were given the covid-19 vaccine and the other half given a control (either a meningococcal conjugate vaccine or saline). After a dosing error led to a small group of participants receiving half a dose of the covid-19 vaccine, the researchers—with approval from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency—added a half dose plus full dose group.2 This group, however, did not include adults over 55 years old as the low dose was given in an early stage of the trial, before older adults were recruited.

The interim analysis included 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil, 12% older adults, and 83% white). Most were aged 18-55 years (82%); people aged 56 years and older will be studied in future analyses of the trial, the researchers have said.

Merryn Voysey, study author and lead statistician at the Oxford Vaccine Group said, “In future analyses, with more data included as it becomes available, we will investigate differences in key subgroups such as older adults, various ethnicities, doses, and timing of booster vaccines, and we will determine which immune responses equate to protection from infection or disease.”

Alongside asymptomatic infections, another secondary outcome of the trial was prevention of severe disease. The paper found that, from 21 days after the first dose, 10 cases of patients being admitted to hospital for covid-19 were reported, all of which were in the control arm. Two of these cases were classified as severe, including one death.

The trial also monitored safety for a median of 3.4 months in all 23 745 participants from the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Of these participants, 168 experienced a total of 175 severe adverse events over the period, but 172 of these were deemed unrelated to the covid-19 or control vaccines. Of the three events remaining, one was in the control group (a case of haemolytic anaemia), one was in the covid-19 vaccine group (a case of transverse myelitis considered possibly related to the vaccine), and the third was a case of severe fever (>40°C) reported in a participant who remains masked to group allocation and recovered rapidly without an alternative diagnosis or being admitted to hospital.

Meanwhile, another covid-19 vaccine candidate—developed by state owned Chinese company Sinopharm and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products—has reportedly been found to be 86% effective against covid-19.3 The United Arab Emirate’s Ministry of Health and Prevention released a statement on 9 December claiming that it had reviewed the interim analysis of a phase III trial that is ongoing in the country and has enrolled 31 000 people. They reported that the inactivated vaccine was 100% effective at preventing moderate and severe cases of the disease and had no serious safety concerns. But no further details have been released. In September, this vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation by the United Arab Emirates and was rolled out to frontline workers.",22,0.055,0.062,0.883,-0.7278

gfersd7,2020-12-10,"I'll give a stab at an ELI5 for p-values, confidence intervals, frequentist and bayesian statistics, and credible intervals.

Let's say you want to find out whether a coin is fair, or how effective a vaccine is at preventing disease -- or whether it's effective *at all*. Different schools of statistical theory will take different approaches to answer those questions (but there is significant overlap in reality). A *frequentist* will likely start out calculating a *p*-value. Let's use the ""fair coin"" example first. They will start by **assuming the coin is fair** (this is known as the *null hypothesis*). Then they will flip the coin a certain number of times, and count how many heads and tails they got. If they get a shocking number of total heads or tails, they'd use that as evidence that the null hypothesis (""the coin is fair"") is *wrong*. That's what the *p*-value measures. It's how unlikely it'd be to get at least that number of heads (or tails) given that the coin is fair. It is *not* how confident they are that it's a fair coin.

Here's a concrete example: let's flip the coin 100 times, and say we observe 70 heads and 30 tails. That sure *seems* unlikely if the coin were fair, but we can calculate *precisely* how unlikely it is to get results at least that extreme. I don't want to get this comment removed by including an unapproved source, so feel free to google *binomial calculator* and plug in the values. You'll see that the probability that you get 70 or more heads in 100 tries *if the coin is fair* is 0.0000392507 (the probability goes from 0 to 1, so if you want a percentage, multiply by 100). Now, we didn't know ahead of time whether it's biased toward heads or tails, so we have to include the fact that it could've just as easily been 70 tails and 30 heads, (take a **two-sided** test), to get 0.0000785014 (double). That is, in only about 1 in 13,000 times you try this experiment would you get results this extreme **if the coin were fair**. You'd probably then conclude, ""this coin is probably NOT fair"". Lots of scientists use the ""1 in 20 or less often"" standard (ie - p <= 0.05) to determine whether they should ""reject the null hypothesis"" and conclude that something *is* biased or something *is* effective. This is an arbitrary threshold, though, and can vary depending on scientific discipline.

Here's a big and important point, though. We **cannot say that the odds of the coin being fair are 1 in 13,000** based on that analysis. We *assumed* it was fair -- we can't both say ""it **is** true"" and ""it has this certain probability of being true"". The results are simply a piece of evidence we've gathered. To see this more clearly, imagine you pick up a coin on the street and flip it four times. They all come up tails. At this point, would you conclude that there's about a 90% chance that it's a loaded coin? I wouldn't. The best you could say is that it was *somewhat* unlikely to get that result if the coin were fair. Would your confidence change (for example) if you picked it up outside of a magic store rather than a bank? Frequentist statistics generally ignores that type of information. 

With frequentist statistics, we can also calculate something called a *confidence interval*. This is where we assume that the coin has some *fixed* but unknown probability of coming up heads. Call that number `x` -- if it were perfectly fair, `x` would be 1/2, or 0.5. We then design an experiment where we ""sample"" the coin a certain number of times times (eg - flip it and count). Then, before we actually perform the experiment, we come up with a mathematical way to make intervals where 95% of the time that we make these intervals when we run the experiment, they contain `x`. I know this is a confusing sentence, but bear with me. For a coin flip experiment, there are a number of different ways to build these intervals (they're called ""binomial proportion confidence intervals""), so we pick one ahead of time. In this sense, a confidence interval is more of a **procedure**. Now that we've designed our experiment and chosen our confidence interval procedure, it'll pump out a new confidence interval every time we run it. In the long run, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals will contain `x`. **This is the definition of a confidence interval**.

Once we've chosen a procedure for generating the confidence intervals (let's say Wilson's method), then we run the experiment, gather the data, and finally calculate the interval for *this specific* experiment. Let's say that the experiment was 70 heads, 30 tails again. We calculate a confidence interval of (0.6042 to 0.7811) (again, I'd provide links, but don't want to get them removed. You can google wilson's method calculator.). The natural intuition is to think that means, ""we can be 95% confident that `x` is between 0.6042 and 0.7811"". This is, unfortunately, wrong. `x` is either in that interval or not. The 95% confidence is about the **interval-generating procedure**. It's difficult to provide a brief and intuitive example of why it matters, but [you can read much more about it here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8). That said, in *many or even most practical* cases, the Confidence Interval will be very numerically similar to the Bayesian ""Credible Interval"", which *does* measure exactly what we want. 

Bayesian statistics takes a different approach. The idea is that we have an existing confidence (probability distribution) in a hypothesis, and we examine new data, and update our confidence based on it. For instance, if you got a coin directly from the US Mint, you'd already be *pretty confident* that the probability of getting heads is actually 0.5 or very close to it. It would take quite a bit of evidence to make you seriously doubt that. However, if you picked it up outside of a joke shop, you'd have a lot less confidence going into the experiment. That existing confidence is called your *prior probability*. Once you've performed the experiment and updated your beliefs, they're called your *posterior probability* (which then would become your prior for the next experiment). This updating of priors to posteriors in light of new data is the point of Bayesian reasoning. We actually assign probability to hypotheses instead of merely assuming they're true or false.

The calculations can be cumbersome since they rely on prior *distributions* rather than single numbers, and people's idea of a ""reasonable"" prior distribution can be big points of contention, but the effort can be worth it if you want to say things like, ""we can be 95% confident that the coin's heads-bias is between 0.6 and 0.7"" and actually mean exactly that. That's what a Credible Interval measures. I'm afraid an ELI5 for even the coin flip example will take up thousands of words, but it's very interesting and worth investigating.",4,0.16,0.043,0.797,0.9994
gfb018b,2020-12-10,"> The difference might just be random

One of the main points of statistics is to separate the signal from the noise. Here, it appears that it's effective against asymptomatic infections. What's **not** in question is whether it's effective against *symptomatic* infections. There is no doubt.

Antivaxxers point to things like the Polio vaccine and say the downturn in polio cases is due to better hygiene, economic improvement, improvement in general health, etc. None of that can be applied to India. It is an open and shut case. 

Rabies is another obvious one. A 100% fatality rate brought down to a 0% fatality rate if you get the vaccine in time. Nobody wants to die of rabies. Nobody would deny the vaccine if they got bitten by a foamy raccoon. 

As for the COVID vaccine- what we need is instagram celebrities, pop stars, Hollywood celebrities, and other ""influencer"" types publicly on board- taking the vaccine on camera, etc. People like Fauci need not be relied upon to make up the brunt of the COVID vaccine PR campaign.

Fact 1. ADE seen in aged (and not selected to only look at the healthiest) but not young animals after vaccination for SARS:

> To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/

Fact 2. ADE found only at low concentrations of anti-spike (S1 subunit) antibodies towards SARS:

> We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.

Fact 3. Same thing seen as in #2 for SARS2 when checked:

> However, when viruses infect cells expressing Fc receptors, such as Raji, K562, or primary immune cells, the antibody at suboptimal neutralizing concentration promotes virus entry into cells through interaction between antibody and Fc receptors (Figure 9). We found that amino acid substitutions F342L and E516A on RBD allowed the virus escape from the neutralization by 7F3 without reducing binding affinity to antibody.

> These results also suggest that ADE may be more likely to occur at later time points after recovery from COVID-19 when the concentration of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection have waned to suboptimal neutralizing level.

The observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time, but FDA will recommend surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations. 

And per Dr. Google (Mayo clinic):

BACKGROUND

NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.

METHODS

We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-μg and 25-μg doses, with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assignments) in 131 healthy adults. In phase 1, vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity; laboratory values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administration toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti–spike protein response (in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units). Secondary outcomes included unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay), and T-cell responses (cytokine staining). IgG and microneutralization assay results were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic. We performed a primary analysis at day 35.

RESULTS

After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive placebo. No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration (mean, ≤2 days). One participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day. Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events. The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose–sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-μg adjuvanted regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutralization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS

At 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum. The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype.

>**Background:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.  
>  
>**Methods:** In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.  
>  
>**Results:** A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.  
>  
>**Conclusions:** A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

The problem is, the adenovirus vector codes its own additional proteins. 

If those proteins are too immunogenic, they steal the limelight from the coronavirus spike - leading to weaker and/or less frequent immunity to the spike. 

The vaccine is given in two doses. The first time, it is mostly meet-and-greet; but on the second dose, the immune system reliably remembers the repeated exposure. 

If the same adenovirus protein dominates both times, especially if the dose is high, the immune system will dutifully develop immunity to that adenovirus first, and to coronavirus spike second (if at all).

The rationale for using two different adenoviruses is as follows: having the same coronavirus spike both times, but different adenovirus proteins on the 1st and 2nd dose will let the immune system develop strong immunity to the spike first and foremost. Gamaleya Sputnik V vaccine itself uses a similar principle. One kind of adenovirus is used for the 1st dose, and another for the 2nd.",10,0.076,0.043,0.881,0.8381

- Phase 1/2 interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years
- Insufficient response in older adults demonstrates the need to refine the concentration of antigen in order to provide high-level immune response across all age groups
- Companies plan a Phase 2b study with an improved antigen formulation
With support from BARDA as part of Operation Warp Speed, study to start in February 2021, including a proposed comparison with an authorized COVID-19 vaccine
- Product availability now expected in Q4 2021 pending successful completion of the development plan 

PARIS and LONDON – December 11, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK announce a delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine program to improve immune response in older adults. Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen.

A recent challenge study in non-human primates performed with an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the vaccine candidate could protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days. These results increase the Companies confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults.

Sanofi’s recombinant technology and GSK’s pandemic adjuvant are established vaccine platforms that have proven successful against influenza. The recombinant technology offers the advantages of stability at temperatures used for routine vaccines, the ability to generate high and sustained immune responses, and the potential to prevent virus transmission.

“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data. We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine. Following these results and the latest encouraging new preclinical data, we will now work to further optimize our candidate to achieve this goal,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a COVID-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response with an acceptable reactogenicity profile. It is also clear that multiple vaccines will be needed to contain the pandemic. Our aim now is to work closely with our partner Sanofi to develop this vaccine, with an improved antigen formulation, for it to make a meaningful contribution to preventing COVID-19.”

The Companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February 2021 with support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) under contract W15QKN-16-9-1002. The study will include a proposed comparison with an authorized COVID-19 vaccine. If data are positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in Q2 2021. Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021.

Sanofi and GSK adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine candidate was selected in July 2020 by U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed in order to accelerate its development and manufacturing.

The Companies have updated Governments and the European Commission where a contractual commitment to purchase the vaccine has been made.

**Phase 1/2 study**

The interim Phase 1/2 results showed a level of neutralizing antibody titers after two doses comparable to sera from patients who recovered from COVID-19, a balanced cellular response in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but insufficient neutralizing antibody titers in adults over the age of 50. The candidate showed transient but higher than expected levels of reactogenicity likely due to the suboptimal antigen formulation, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine candidate. The most favorable results were observed in the group which tested the highest antigen concentration, combined with the GSK adjuvant, showing neutralization titers in 88% of participants. Seroconversion was observed in 89.6% of the 18 to 49 age group; 85% in the >50 age group; and 62.5% in the >60 age group.

The Phase 1/2 clinical study is a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity (immune response) of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A total of 441 healthy adults participated in the study, across 10 investigational sites in the United States. The participants received one or two doses of the vaccine candidate, or placebo at 21 days apart.

Full results of the Phase 1/2 study will be published as soon as all data are available, following peer-reviewed publication process.

**Latest preclinical results**

A recent preclinical study using a highly virulent challenge in non-human primates, showed high ability for the vaccine to protect against lung pathology and reduce virus in the nose and lungs within 2 to 4 days. Results from this pre-clinical study confirm strong ability of the vaccine candidate to stop the replication of the virus with an optimal antigen formulation.

These data are being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed publication.

**On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19**

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is developing a messenger RNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. Preclinical data showed that two immunizations of the mRNA vaccine induced high neutralizing antibody levels that are comparable to the upper range of those observed in infected humans.

The NHRA’s decision to approve and use the vaccine is based on the clinical trials data conducted across several countries, which was thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by the Authority. Results from Phase III clinical trials showed an 86% efficacy rate, a 99% seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibody and 100% effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19, following testing on 42,299 volunteers

 

The NHRA further verified the quality of the vaccine by reviewing the scientific data behind the manufacturing process and the stability of the product, in addition to ensuring the manufacturer's commitment to applying the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), in accordance to international standards in the pharmaceutical industry and requirements issued by the NHRA.

 

Additionally, the NHRA also consulted with the Clinical Research Committee at NHRA, comprised of medical specialists, researchers, academics and doctors, also responsible for approving clinical trials, as well as the approval of the immunization committee.

>This is the first study of COVI-VAC in humans. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of COVI-VAC (a live attenuated vaccine to prevent COVID-19) in healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years. Approximately 48 participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 dose groups (low, medium, high). Within each of these dose groups, participants will be assigned randomly to receive either 2 doses of COVI-VAC 28 days apart, 2 doses of placebo (saline), or 1 dose of COVI-VAC and 1 dose of placebo. COVI-VAC or placebo is administered by drops into each nostril. Neither the participants nor the researchers will know whether COVI-VAC or placebo has been received.

>To assess the safety of the vaccine, each participant will record symptoms and oral temperature in a diary daily for 14 days after each dose. Safety laboratory tests, physical exams, ECGs, and a chest X-ray will also be performed, and peak expiratory flow and vital signs will be measured. Adverse events and medication use will be recorded.

>Blood samples and intranasal samples will be collected to assess the immune response from the vaccine.

My understanding is that it's intended to be a single-dose vaccine, with the second dose acting as a challenge to assess the immune response. Though I suppose it tests a prime-boost schedule too.

(SIIPL) today announced that a Phase 1 clinical trial of COVI-VAC received regulatory approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and has commenced in London, UK. COVI-VAC is a single-dose intranasal, live attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that was shown to be safe and efficacious in preclinical animal studies. COVI-VAC was developed with Codagenix's Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) platform that uses synthetic biology to re-code the genes of viruses into safe and stable vaccines. COVI-VAC is designed to deliver a safe, live attenuated version of SARS-CoV-2 that may induce a more robust immune response and long-lasting cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to other vaccines against the virus.

>COVI-VAC has the potential to address several key logistical challenges to immunization against SARS-CoV-2 at a global scale.  As a single-dose, intranasally-delivered vaccine, COVI-VAC will not require a needle and syringe, nor ultra-low temperature freezers. COVI-VAC can be manufactured at large scale and supports ease of administration in a mass vaccination campaign.

>The Phase 1 trial of COVI-VAC is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of COVI-VAC administered by nose drops. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate immunogenicity, or the vaccine's ability to provoke an immune response, measured as neutralizing antibody, mucosal IgA and cellular immune responses.

This paper discusses the mechanisms - reduced mRNA stability seems to be important, kind of the opposite of what the mRNA vaccine developers are trying to achieve. So you end up with a virus that does what normal viruses do but is much slower at producing new viral proteins.

>Codon pair deoptimization is an efficient virus attenuation strategy, but the mechanism that leads to attenuation is unknown. The strategy involves synthetic recoding of viral genomes that alters the positions of synonymous codons, thereby increasing the number of suboptimal codon pairs and CpG dinucleotides in recoded genomes. Here we identify the molecular mechanism of codon pair deoptimization-based attenuation by studying recoded influenza A viruses. We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes. Consequently, reduced protein production directly causes virus attenuation. Our study provides evidence that suboptimal codon pairs are major determinants of mRNA stability. Additionally, it demonstrates that codon pair bias can be used to increase mRNA stability and protein production of synthetic genes in many areas of biotechnology.",4,0.082,0.021,0.898,0.9011

The randomized, observer blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 trial called HERALD will assess the safety and efficacy of CVnCoV in adults at a dose of 12 µg. The study is expected to include more than 35,000 participants at sites in Europe and Latin America.

>“With the start of the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study, we have reached another important milestone in the development of our vaccine candidate, CVnCoV,” said Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, CEO of CureVac. “The clinical safety and immunogenicity data achieved to date look promising and we are hopeful that this trial will continue to demonstrate the impact of mRNA technology and our vaccine to prevent COVID-19, and to help defeat this pandemic.”

>The HERALD trial will start with an initial Phase 2b part, which is expected to seamlessly merge into a Phase 3 efficacy trial. Subjects 18 years of age or older will be enrolled at multiple sites and will receive a two-dose schedule of either SARS-CoV-2 or placebo.

>Besides the primary safety objective, the study design includes two primary efficacy objectives: the demonstration of the efficacy of CVnCoV in preventing first episodes of confirmed cases of COVID-19 of any severity, as well as preventing moderate to severe confirmed cases of COVID-19 in participants who have never been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

>Efficacy of CVnCoV will be assessed by an event-driven analysis based on a certain number of participants who present with laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease during the study. To ensure continued and close safety monitoring of the participants in the trial, data will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board on a regular basis.

>Following completion of the trial, subjects will continue to be monitored in a 1-year extension study. The extension study will collect additional data to evaluate long-term safety, persistence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of COVID-19 cases to assess the duration of vaccine efficacy.

The proposed use under an EUA is for active immunization for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The proposed dosing regimen is 2 doses, 100 μg each, administered 1 month apart.   
>  
>The EUA request includes safety and efficacy data from an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial of mRNA-1273 in approximately 30,400 participants. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction of incidence of COVID-19 among participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the first dose of vaccine in the period after 14 days post-dose 2. In an interim analysis conducted using a data cutoff of November 7, 2020, a total of 27,817 participants randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo with a median 7 weeks of follow-up post-dose 2 were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis population of participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination. Efficacy in preventing confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after the second dose of vaccine was 94.5.0% (95% CI 86.5%, 97.8%) with 5 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 90 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across age groups, genders, racial and ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19. Secondary efficacy analyses suggested benefit of the vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19 (11 protocol-defined severe COVID-19 cases in the placebo group vs. 0 cases in the vaccine group), in preventing COVID-19 following the first dose, and in preventing COVID-19 in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, although available data for some of these outcomes did not allow for firm conclusions. Efficacy data from the final scheduled analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (data cutoff of November 21, 2020, with a median follow-up of >2 months post-dose 2) demonstrated a VE of 94.1% (95% CI 89.3%, 96.8%), with 11 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 185 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group and was consistent with results obtained from the interim analysis. The VE in this analysis when stratified by age group was 95.6% (95% CI: 90.6%, 97.9%) for participants 18 to <65 years of age and 86.4% (95% CI: 61.4%, 95.5%) for participants ≥65 years of age. A final secondary efficacy analysis also supported efficacy against protocol-defined severe COVID-19, with 30 cases in the placebo group vs. 0 cases in the vaccine group.   
>  
>Safety data from a November 11, 2020 interim analysis of approximately 30,350 participants ≥18 years of age randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo with a median of 7 weeks of follow-up after the second dose supported a favorable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA. These safety data are the primary basis of FDA’s safety review. On December 7, 2020, the Sponsor submitted additional follow-up data from these participants with a cutoff of November 25, 2020, which represents a median of 9 weeks (>2 months) of follow-up post-dose 2. Key safety data from this later submission, including death, other serious adverse events, and unsolicited adverse events of interest were independently verified and confirmed not to change the safety conclusions from the interim safety analysis.   
>  
>The most common solicited adverse reactions associated with mRNA-1273 were injection site pain (91.6%), fatigue (68.5%), headache (63.0%), muscle pain (59.6%), joint pain (44.8%), and  6 chills (43.4%); severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.2% to 9.7% of participants, were more frequent after dose 2 than after dose 1, and were generally less frequent in participants ≥65 years of age as compared to younger participants. Among unsolicited adverse events of clinical interest, which could be possibly related to vaccine, using the November 25, 2020 data cutoff, lymphadenopathy was reported as an unsolicited event in 173 participants (1.1%) in the vaccine group and 95 participants (0.63%) in the placebo group. Lymphadenopathy (axillary swelling and tenderness of the vaccination arm) was a solicited adverse reaction observed after any dose in 21.4% of vaccine recipients <65 years of age and in 12.4% of vaccine recipients ≥65 years of age, as compared with 7.5% and 5.8% of placebo recipients in those age groups, respectively. There was a numerical imbalance in hypersensitivity adverse events across study groups, with 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients reporting such events in the safety population. There were no anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with close temporal relation to the vaccine. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, there were three reports of facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of adverse events (including other neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to mRNA-1273.   
>  
>The frequency of serious adverse events was low (1.0% in the mRNA-1273 arm and 1.0% in the placebo arm), without meaningful imbalances between study arms. The most common SAEs in the vaccine group which were numerically higher than the placebo group were myocardial infarction (0.03%), cholecystitis (0.02%), and nephrolithiasis (0.02%), although the small numbers of cases of these events do not suggest a causal relationship. The most common SAEs in the placebo arm which were numerically higher than the vaccine arm, aside from COVID-19 (0.1%), were pneumonia (0.05%) and pulmonary embolism (0.03%).   
>  
>With the exception of more frequent, generally mild to moderate reactogenicity in participants <65 years of age, the safety profile of mRNA-1273 was generally similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without medical comorbidities, and participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment.   
>  
>This meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is being convened to discuss and provide recommendations on whether, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the benefits of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.

BAT's biotechnology subsidiary in the U.S. announced today that a Phase 1 study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Enrollment in the trial is expected to begin shortly. The COVID-19 vaccine candidate (KBP-COVID-19; NCT04473690) thus joins a group of potential vaccines that have advanced beyond the preclinical testing phase.
 
The study design calls for enrolling a total of 180 healthy volunteers, who would be divided into two age cohorts, 18 to 49 years and 50 to 70 years. Each group would then in turn be divided into a low-dose treatment group and a high-dose treatment group (N=45) and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the low dose (15 micrograms of KBP-COVID-19 vaccine + 0.5 mg adjuvant) or placebo, or the high dose (45 micrograms of KBP-COVID-19 vaccine + 0.5 mg adjuvant) or placebo, respectively. Results from the trial would be expected in mid-2021 and, if positive and regulatory approval is obtained, would allow for a transition into the Phase 2 trial.
 
A range of potential benefits
 
The vaccine candidate was ""developed using KBP's innovative, fast-growing, plant-based technology,"" according to the company. This ""unique approach"" offers a number of potential advantages, it said, such as the rapid production of the vaccine's active ingredients in about six weeks, compared with several months using conventional methods. The vaccine candidate also has the potential to remain stable at room temperature, he said, which could be a significant benefit to healthcare and healthcare systems around the world.

gg0i5hn,2020-12-16,"**Abstract**

**Background:** BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

**Methods:** We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, and 6 μg with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

**Results:** Reactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-μg and 6-μg Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

**Conclusions:** BBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2°C and 8°C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

gg7wtjf,2020-12-17,"Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 imposes an urgent need for rapid development of an efficient and cost-effective vaccine, suitable for mass immunization. Here, we show the development of a replication competent recombinant VSV-∆G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV is replaced by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine indicates the expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in-vivo model for COVID-19 is implemented. We show that a single-dose vaccination results in a rapid and potent induction of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss, and  alleviation of the extensive tissue damage and viral loads in lungs and nasal turbinates. Taken together, we suggest the recombinant VSV-∆G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",6,0.098,0.043,0.858,0.7783

BACKGROUND

Testing of vaccine candidates to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an older population is important, since increased incidences of illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been associated with an older age.

METHODS

We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart.

RESULTS

Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.

CONCLUSIONS

In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

- For the DTaP vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), five childhood doses: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years, with subsequent boosters every 10 years to maintain immunity.
- For measles, two shots (one is already 93% effective, two 97%, probably for life): first shot at 9-12 months, booster at least one month later (typically age 15-18 months in US). 
- For hepatitis A, for optimal long-term protection (at least 15 years, probably a lot longer): two shots, six months apart.

BACKGROUND

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.

METHODS

In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 μg of BNT162b1), participants received one dose.

RESULTS

A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.

CONCLUSIONS

The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential to avert the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine, which is comprised of CHO-expressed spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and nitrogen bisphosphonates-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). This vaccine candidate rapidly elicited the robust humoral response, Th1/Th2 balanced helper CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell immune response in animal models. In mice, hamsters, and non-human primates, 2-shot and 3-shot immunization of StriFK-FH002C generated 28- to 38-fold and 47- to 269-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than the human COVID-19 convalescent plasmas, respectively. More importantly, the StriFK-FH002C immunization conferred sterilizing immunity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which also protected animals from virus-induced weight loss, COVID-19-like symptoms, and pneumonia in hamsters. Vaccine-induced neutralizing and cell-based receptor-blocking antibody titers correlated well with protective efficacy in hamsters, suggesting vaccine-elicited protection is immune-associated. The StriFK-FH002C provided a promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate for further clinical evaluation.",8,0.168,0.024,0.809,0.9657

**Background**

A safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

**Methods**

We did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

**Findings**

Between June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 μg or 50 μg dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 μg group) and 93% (the 50 μg group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 μg group and 117.8 for the 50 μg group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 μg group and 69.1 for the 50 μg group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 μg group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 μg group

**Interpretation**

The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 μg vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

ggplnjl,2020-12-22,"Ok I went down a rabbit hole today on this topic.

In 2016, in a STATnews article, this was said about drugs Moderna was developping: ""\[mRNA\] work better if they’re wrapped up in a delivery mechanism, such as nanoparticles made of lipids. But those nanoparticles can lead to dangerous side effects, especially if a patient has to take repeated doses over months or years."" And for this reason, they had to halt all drug production, and they switched over to vaccine research.

So I know the vaccine is only 2 doses, so that immediately decreases the side effects of the lipid nanoparticles. But what bothers me, is I have been searching online all day for an explanation for HOW they changed these nanoparticles from the ones they used in 2016 to now, because I assume there was a change. It seems Moderna is super secretive and doesn't publish much of their research and [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3488) even called them out on this a few years ago.

All that being said, I don't believe there is a conspiracy, I'd still happily take the vaccine, and I believe whatever effects of the nanoparticles must be minimal with only 2 doses. However, I am not impressed with Moderna and their veil of secrecy, it certainly gives me some pause. And I don't want to create any alarm, because, again, I think the vaccine is safe, BUT it is dishonest to say we know 100% that nanoparticles have no effects, it seems like we do not know much about how nanoparticles act within the body and they are hard to study because they are so small.

This statement is not supported by the facts. 

Specific language matters. Four cases of Bell's palsy occurred in the vaccine arm of the trial, which is only slightly more than the background number you'd expect in the population (you'd expect 2-3 over the same time frame). One can not, therefore, conclude that the vaccine ""resulted"" in the Bell's Palsy. Nobody in the placebo arm got Bell's Palsy, when you would have expected 2-3 cases in that group, too ... so by the same logic that the vaccine ""resulted"" in the Bell's Palsy it some, you would have to claim that the placebo ""prevented"" it in others. Neither conclusion, in fact, is warranted based on the data. 

> There’s also been incidences of severe allergic reactions in people with no history of allergies and logically, there will be more accounts of adverse effects as more people take it

Of course there will!

Allergic reactions to vaccines happen all the time. This is why every vaccine clinic in the country always has epinephrine on hand. The allergic reactions people have to vaccines are trivially easy to treat, as well - they show up within a few minutes, and are solved with a simple jab. 

As far as other severe reactions, if you waved her hands vaguely over the head of 1,000,000 40-59 year olds, about 5,000 of them would have heart attacks in the next three months.  This is the context in which you need to evaluate all fo the reports 

There will undoubtably (especially because one of the priority groups is nursing home residents, who have a low life expectancy and a high rate of medical complications) be people who get the vaccine and have a heart attack or a stroke that week. Thousands of them will die in the months after they're vaccinated. 

These will be recorded and listed in VAERS because that's what VAERS does. But there's a fallacy you don't appear to understand, based on your Bell's Palsy error: *post hoc ergo propter hoc*: ""After, therefore because of.""

There is an urgent requirement for safe and effective vaccines to prevent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We have used ferret and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine in ferrets or unvaccinated macaques. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen at seven days post infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed early in the infection (day 7) but was resolved by day 15. We also demonstrate that formaldehyde treatment of SARS-CoV-2 reduces exposure of the spike receptor binding domain providing a mechanistic explanation for suboptimal immunity.",2,0.075,0.053,0.872,-0.0612

Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either each antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and was maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks. These data support the utility of spike subunit-based antigens as a vaccine for use in humans.",5,0.04,0.013,0.947,0.6858

Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, 3µ and 6µ with Algel-IMDG.

**Methods**

We conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3µ with Algel-IMDG and 6µ with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion (4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose).

**Findings**

Among 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92.9% (88.2, 96.2) and 98.3% (95.1, 99.6) in the 3µ and 6µ with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6.9, 13.2) and 10.3% (7.4, 13.8) in the 3µ and 6µ with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73.5% (63.6, 81.9), 81.1% (71.4, 88.1), and 73.1% (62.9, 81.8) of individuals in the 3µ with Algel-IMDG, 6µ with Algel-IMDG, and 6µ with Algel groups, respectively.

**Interpretation**

In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6µ Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.

The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 μg of CVnCoV were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination. These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.",18,0.157,0.044,0.799,0.9583

J&J has an unknown Q1 target but if it was 100 million and effective then that would be 200 million people in Q1. The gap between trial start and manufacturing is not clear.

In the US 80 million people are < 18 year old on about 330 million; leaving a population of only 250 million. If 80% of people take the vaccine quickly that is only 200 million people. So if all the manufacturing hits and J&J works you can get to everyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine a lot faster than 6 months at least in terms of factory supply.

ghbja4i,2020-12-28,"I think technically yes they can do it, but realize as I note above the population under study won't be to the standards they requested in terms of diversity and other factors so it is unlikely to be the basis of an EUA.

Remember the VRBPAC debated a long time on the approval of Pfizer's vaccine just because the EUA stated 16+ instead of 18+ and the fact that there were not huge number of 16-18 year old in the trial set with 4 members voting against the EUA just because of that even though there are excellent physiological arguments to be made on an 18 year old being essentially the same as a 16 year old and that any 2 year group had few people in it, etc.

I cannot say for sure, I'm not qualified nor on the VRBPAC but I cannot imagine them approving Oxford's vaccine in the US until the US trial finishes. Doubly so if J&J's vaccine is effective. 

Consider that if J&J's is effective the daily average of vaccines delivered in the US would need to be close to 3 million shots a day (including second doses). The US has managed to deliver 2 million in several weeks. Things might accelerate but the number of shots to deliver into arms is very large already with 3 approved vaccines. 

Finally an EUA requires there to be no other products on the market that are better. If the efficacy of J&J is higher than that of the Oxford vaccine that also will make it harder to approve, they can still approve a less effective product if there is no supply but it hard to make that argument again if there are piles on the shelf of more effective things and you just can't put them into arms fast enough. Oxford will get used heavily world wide. But I doubt the US will use it until late Feb at the soonest and the US may never use it if J&J is able to deliver a lot of doses and is more effective.",7,0.106,0.06,0.834,0.9711

ghcvqbx,2020-12-28,"We do not know how sustained the immunity would be with just 1 dose. The reason J&J's vaccine is 1 dose is they observed in the earlier phases of trials the things that are normally correlates of immunity continued to rise for like 60 days that is why the 2 dose version of J&J's trial is a second dose not after 3 or 4 weeks but after 8 weeks. 

I sadly think we are going to see a failure to get system properly ready to deliver vaccines at the volume needed. I hope I am wrong. It is inexcusable too because everyone know since Oct the cold chain and that vaccines would likely be coming. 11 million doses have been available and only 2 million have been used. That is a lot of lives you can protect. 

If the bottleneck at point of delivery continues they might open the valves up on who can get vaccines because they simply need to move them via every channel they can. That is the reality honestly. A normal flu vaccine delivers something like 185 million shots in the US. To get to 200 million people we need to deliver between 400 million and 300 million shots depending on what we use. Flu vaccination typically lasts a few months. Right now the only places putting shots in arms are nursing facilities and hospitals. Work places, doctors offices, pharmacies, etc. All need to start dosing people.

If I were in charge of anything I would just have various means of providing people a code to sign up for an appointment and attach the code to an SSN or something else like a drivers license, etc. To verify it is you. There would be some fraud/line jumping I am sure, but we need to move.

Right now the output looks like 4.5 million people per week with the two mRNA ones. That means they are producing about 9 million doses a week. They have 120 weeks to the end of Q1 and have promised 200 million doses, which is 16 million/week. So we need to expect/hope for even more floods of these products than we are seeing now. 

If they want to slow walk the health care phase 1A provider doses I'm okay with that, they can't have everyone out on the same day who gets a level 3 event, but the doses into care facilities need to go out weeks ago. Half of the mortality is in that group.",5,0.097,0.042,0.861,0.9735
ghdcv7j,2020-12-28,"The most likely thing to be approved for kids will be Pfizer and Moderna because their trials are going down to 12 now and they will have longer data and thus be approved generally first.

I would not expect people under 16 to be approved until late summer/fall if this year at all. EUAs require the benefits to clearly outweigh the risks. Although there are important society level effects by perhaps reducing transmission in the very young the individual benefit is much harder to show. It is several orders of magnitude less risk.

Novavax's product could become a very standard vaccination to give and their trial with flu in the UK could show a regular booster approach. Indeed you could look at Novavax as a long game type product.

It will be very interesting if its age profile is flat. I'd guess it won't be and will not work as well in the elderly because that type of vaccine for other things does not. So the mRNA, viral vector, protein sub-unit comparison of age/platforms is very interesting here.

If the virus just circulates in the young it will still be a major problem for society though, so either by natural infection or vaccines they will need to come out of the population somehow. The timing is just likely to be quite late.

I actually expect pretty close to full vaccination early in Q2. Largely because we know there should be enough doses of the two mRNAs to complete vaccination in Q2 now, and any further approvals just move the date to the left; assuming last mile and uptake are not the bottlenecks. I agree with Fauci it should be very widely available in April, perhaps even March even if just 1 other vaccine is approved that should be the case, but particularly if that other vaccine is J&J's 1 dose vaccine.",4,0.075,0.025,0.9,0.9046

Main danger seems to be efficacy not being strong enough/fading in the interval and that the second dose/boost wouldn't work as well if taken later. I'm not an expert in this field but it appears the UK experts seem to think this risk is either low or simply worth taking to bring the benefit of some protection to more brits and save lives.

>The timing of priming and booster vaccine administration varied between studies.

But nobody is suggesting giving one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, nor any other of the approved candidates.

Two doses is expected to confer more durable immunity and give stronger protection in general--  as is intuitive with foundational knowledge on immunology.

The clinical study carried out in Brazil involved the participation of 12,400 volunteer health professionals in 16 research centers.

>“Today is a very important day for Brazil, Brazilians, health and life. Instituto Butantan's vaccine is 78% to 100% effective against COVID-19, according to studies in Brazil, ”said Governor João Doria. “As Governor of São Paulo, I want to thank the more than 12 thousand volunteers who agreed to participate in this research coordinated by Butantan and centers of excellence in eight Brazilian states. Also thank the researchers, doctors and scientists who helped and contributed to find this great result. Our recognition and our gratitude. ”

>**The efficacy rate was 78%** for those infected who had mild cases or needed outpatient care. This means that for every hundred volunteers who contracted the virus, only 22 had only mild symptoms, but without the need for hospitalization.

gikh7ef,2021-01-08,"I followed this closely yesterday. There was a bit of an overreaction from certain journalists, but also legitimate questions. Here's the takeaway:

1. Instituto Butantan has received the revised report of the Brazilian arm of the research from Austrian researchers, and they considered the results a success.

2. There was a press conference to announce this. It was not intended was a scientific event, just as an announcement to the public, because it is a public institution. Compare it to a company message to shareholders. 

3. The only numbers presented were 78% efficacy for ""mild cases"", 100% for ""severe cases"". No raw numbers, no confidence interval. The 100% number for severe cases is particularly misleading, because it is likely based on few cases.

4. Journalists were understandably unsatisfied, and asked for more data. There was a bit of an uncomfortable situation in the conference, and under pressure, the director of the institute gave the number of Covid cases found in the main and in the control groups from memory, but it wasn't meant as official data. He promised the full study would be released soon, after the preliminary review from the national health agency. Confidence interval for the 78% number was released in a promotional video a bit later, but journalists that were there didn't see it immediately.

5. A few journalists that have no experience with scientific studies decided to ""reverse engineer"" the ""real efficacy"" from the two numbers informally presented by the Butantan director in response to a question. They started to treat as fact a lower, ~62% efficacy, a number that they calculated themselves without access to the study and without taking into account possible differences in sample sizes, stratification etc.

6. Treating this apocryphal number as fact, more journalists concluded that the Butantan had excluded infection cases from the results. Most seemed to be under the impression that phase 3 trials submit all participants to regular RNA testing, which is obviously not true. Symptoms are the first trigger. This impression was somewhat reinforced by some of the specialists interviewed by the press, but they also didn't have any involvement with the study.

7. A competent journalist working for the University of São Paulo reached out to someone who was actually in the study, and this researcher said that the Brazilian study used the [WHO progression scale](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/minimalcoreoutcomemeasure.pdf) for Covid symptoms / infection, 0 being no virus found; 1 - asymptomatic; 2 - symptomatic, independent; 3 - Symptomatic, assistance needed, 4 - hospitalized etc. According to this [source](https://jornal.usp.br/ciencias/eficaz-em-prevenir-doenca-grave-e-morte-por-covid-coronavac-deve-ter-impacto-em-frear-pandemia/), only level 3 and higher qualified. Level 1 was generally excluded from phase 3 trials, but at least part of level 2 cases were included in other studies. It is unclear whether this was the criteria for triggering tests from the start, or if existing cases were deliberately excluded from yesterday's report (which would confirm the suspicions of aforementioned journalists). This is unclear because the [study protocols](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13063-020-04775-4/MediaObjects/13063_2020_4775_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) state that participants were instructed to immediately ""report fever or any symptoms that could be linked to Covid-19""; after that, they would be tested and directed to a physician for clinical assessment. Thus, every participant reporting symptoms would have been subjected to medical assistance, rendering meaningless the distinction between level 2 and level 3 cases, which is based on the idea that people with lesser symptoms will not seek medical help.

In sum, while I'd rather have the full study available as soon as possible, a few journalists were very irresponsible in spreading unofficial numbers they figured out for themselves. I can see that a press conference without full results isn't the best scenario, but this is hardly the first time it's happened with Covid vaccines. We'll have to wait for the results after they come back from regulators, or maybe the Butantan Institute will clear some of these things up. 

To be honest, I don't believe they're being malicious. It's just that Sinovac is very strict with what numbers can and cannot be published by the Brazilian arm alone. It is known that efficacy in Turkey was higher, probably because in Brazil tests were conducted with frontline health workers, which are probably more exposed to the virus than the general population. Sinovac doesn't want the Brazilian numbers to become their whole numbers, it could affect stock prices and whatnot. Brazilians want to get the numbers out there as soon as possible, because they're good enough to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization.

If you actually meant to say reduced and not prevented then just say that. It's not a big deal.

This is literally the definition of semantics.

Here is a paper on vaccine efficacy in Hepatitis A, another intramuscular vaccine. Seems like it’s quite good at preventing infection and transmission contrary to your previous statements that IM vaccines do not prevent transmission. Here’s a direct quote, because I have little faith you’ll actually read it.

Vaccination, when used during hepatitis A outbreaks, is consistently followed by a rapid decline in incidence of new cases, most likely related to reductions of secondary transmission and sub-clinical cases that play a role in maintaining the outbreak. Data from randomized trials are limited, but in a study of household contacts of individuals diagnosed with primary hepatitis A infection, vaccination was approximately 80% effective for prevention of secondary infection.

I can find more this is just the first compared IM vaccine I googled.

Sure, as another comment pointed out, toxoid vaccines do not prevent infection. But otherwise my statement still stands that the mRNA vaccines MOST LIKELY(since you like semantics so much) will prevent infection and transmission.

Just so I beat a dead horse, here is a direct quote from another [article](https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-020-03441-8/d41586-020-03441-8.pdf)

Have a good day.

Pfizer has said that its scientists are looking at ways to assess virus transmission in future studies. For now, AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford might be able to provide the first hints as to whether a vaccine can protect against such transmission. Although they have yet to publish complete results, their trial did routinely test participants for SARS-CoV-2, allowing investigators to track whether people became infected without developing symptoms. Early indications are that the vaccine might have reduced the frequency of such infections, which would suggest that transmission might also be reduced.",0,0.083,0.048,0.87,0.9147
gikiym9,2021-01-08,"No Covid vaccine at this point has assessed in phase 3 trials whether or not they stop people from getting infected and spreading the virus. They all have assessed symptoms, which translates to the current strategy of covering as many people in the group risks as possible, in order to achieve less severe clinical outcomes or, hopefully, asymptomatic cases. 

It is plausible that vaccines would also cause less transmission, but this is not something we can know for sure at this point.",2,0.071,0.078,0.851,0.0876
gjf0cbx,2021-01-08,"> just so you see the facts twice


I've already explained to you the problem with your ""facts"" 

1) your quote from the paper on Hep. A that you're trying to use as some kind of counter evidence against my statements on IM vaccines effects on transmission supports what I wrote (that Intramuscular vaccines typically do not prevent onwards transmission entirely) So it doesn't run contrary to what I stated at all. Additionally Hep. A is not a respiratory viral infection, unlike covid. I specifically mentioned respiratory viral infections in talking about why IM vaccine are expected to be more more limited compared to intranasal. Published data (including data specific to covid vaccine candidates) supports my statement. 

2) you use an old quote about forthcoming AZ data , data that's said is expected *might* show a reduction in transmission (not a prevention) you use that as evidence that you're beating a dead horse..? 

The actual data has been published now, if you were paying attention. It showed a 4% reduction in onward tranmission with the standard regimen, substantially less than the efficacy. (Moderna, and pfizer are also predicted by their own insiders, ceos to have more limited reduction on transmission vs their published efficacy) I 

If somebody told you a mask ""prevents"" covid infection based on one clinical trial that showed a 4% reduction in infection would you have a problem with that? I would. Various advertising agencies and regulatory bodies would too I'm.sure

  It's not semantics, it's about standards. And ethics. This is science, medicine.   The best available data now indicates reduction, not wholesale prevention is what we can expect. Either way we cannot really make a concrete statement.  it's fair to say what I said that  transmission 'may be possible'.  Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not true and it certainly is not misinformation like you said it was. 

You can't be going round telling people that they are prevented from transmission once vaccinated when the evidence is lacking. It's potentially dangerous. And you're acting like it's the mainstream consensus of scientists. You're doing it on the scientific sub where people, perhaps a fair few of them, lacking strong scientific knowledge come to learn. They come to get factual, verifiable information from experts instead of the mass of junk on fb of wherever else. 

Would you be happy if 15 people who had read this thread remembered your words and then went out and socialized with their grandma's after receiving the vaccine, safe in the knowledge they had read an experts comments on a science sub about how the possibility of transmission after being vaccinated was ""misinformation""? 

 i'm not trying to be hyperbolic or extreme but stupider things have happened. A guy died in ecuador recently after some 'expert' advised about injecting chlorine, people drank bleach because of some claims attributed to experts. I don't want people I love and care about to come and read things on places like here that give them false security. At the least I'd rather err to caution . 

Words matter here, I'm not just trying to be cherrypicking semantics for the sake of it. You definitely disagreed with my statement that transmission ""may be possible"" so clearly you have a stronger view than you just using prevent in place of reduce.

But to give you the benefit of the doubt if you say you meant reduce all this time not prevent and it's just a semantic confusion. I'll go with that and agree  with you then.  I still think it's important to point out for the benefit of others, which is replied in the first place. Not to argue just to point out for readers that come here to try and understand. I want them to know that it's not misinformation to imagine you could get infected even after vaccine and you could transmit. 

Whether they believe your post or mine I can't control but at least I can sleep a little easier at night knowing I tried to share correct information.

With sterilising immunity, the virus can’t even gain a toehold in the body because the immune system stops the virus entering cells and replicating.

> There is a subtle yet important difference between preventing disease and preventing infection. A vaccine that “just” prevents disease might not stop you from transmitting the disease to others – even if you feel fine. But a vaccine that provides sterilising immunity stops the virus in its tracks.

> In an ideal world, all vaccines would induce sterilising immunity. In reality, it is actually extremely difficult to produce vaccines that stop virus infection altogether. Most vaccines that are in routine use today do not achieve this. For example, vaccines targeting rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea in infants, are only capable of preventing severe disease.

- 48 volunteers to be evaluated at three dose levels

- Endpoints include safety, tolerability and immunogenicity

- Initial data expected by mid-2021

NEW YORK and PUNE, India, Jan. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Codagenix Inc. and the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL) today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1 clinical trial of COVI-VAC, a single-dose, intranasal, live attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  

Designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study, the Phase 1 trial will evaluate a total of 48 volunteers at multiple dose levels to determine the safety and tolerability COVI-VAC. In addition, the study will evaluate the vaccine's ability to provoke an immune response – measuring neutralizing antibodies, mucosal immunity in the airway and cellular immunity. Codagenix expects to report initial data from the study by mid-2021. Pending results of the Phase 1 trial, Codagenix and SIIPL expect to begin advanced clinical testing in mid-2021. The trial is being conducted by hVIVO in London, UK, a subsidiary of Open Orphan plc.

""Dosing the first patient in the Phase 1 trial is an important milestone in the development of COVI-VAC, which we believe has significant advantages over other vaccines against COVID-19,"" said J. Robert Coleman, Ph.D., CEO of Codagenix. ""Importantly, as a live attenuated vaccine, COVI-VAC has the potential to provide a broader immune response in comparison to other COVID-19 vaccines that target only a portion of the virus. This could prove critical as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have begun to emerge.""

""Given the impressive efficacy signals from the vaccines that have already received emergency use authorization in the U.S., it's tempting to take your foot off the gas if you are developing a different vaccine construct for this terrible virus,"" said Charlie Petty, principal at Adjuvant Capital and Codagenix board member. ""It may sound cliché, but the reality of this pandemic is that none of us is safe until all of us are safe – globally – and that will require billions of vaccines that can be easily delivered and administered. We are optimistic that COVI-VAC can play an important role in achieving equitable access to protection from SARS-CoV-2, and the Serum Institute of India is the ideal partner to achieve our large-scale distribution amibitions.""

COVI-VAC was developed with Codagenix's Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) platform, which uses synthetic biology to re-code the genes of viruses into safe and stable vaccines. COVI-VAC is designed to deliver a safe, live attenuated version of SARS-CoV-2 that may induce a more robust immune response and long-lasting cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to other vaccines against the virus.

Additionally, COVI-VAC has the potential to address several key logistical challenges to immunization against SARS-CoV-2 at a global scale. As a single-dose, intranasally-delivered vaccine, COVI-VAC will not require a needle and syringe, nor ultra-low temperature freezers. COVI-VAC can be manufactured at large scale and can be easily administered with minimal training in a mass vaccination campaign.

""Given the scale and global breadth of the pandemic, multiple vaccines will be needed to ensure equitable access, and COVI-VAC holds great potential to help meet the global demand as a single dose, needle-free vaccine that needs only a standard freezer or fridge,"" said Dr. Coleman. ""In addition, COVI-VAC is ideally suited for mass production using technologies already in place at global manufacturing facilities.""",6,0.139,0.017,0.844,0.9971

Or at least they are presented in such a way that is casting some shadows on the whole trial process and its management by the two above entities (as they are basically relying on a limited analysis of a sub-sub-sub cohort of people which apparently got the doses 12+ wks apart ""by chance"" to demonstrate that the efficacy figures are much better than the initial 62-70% estimate, even with 1 dose only.

We don't know for sure yet how Moderna/Pfizer do with asymptomatic cases, but given that they massively out-perform AstraZeneca's vaccine in efficacy for preventing cases with symptoms (94% vs. 62.1%) and also did a better job preventing monkeys from having detectable virus in their nasal secretions in the early challenge trials, I would be inclined to assume Pfizer/Moderna will also do a better job preventing asymptomatic cases too unless/until there is data to show otherwise.

gj7qbae,2021-01-13,"Since we do not have ph 3 data yet, I think the best comparison regarding ""efficacy"" we have atm would be the challenge trials in macaques:

[AZ/OX](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/i0lqbb/chadox1_ncov19_vaccine_prevents_sarscov2/) - Chimp adenovirus vector, wild type Spike with no stablisation or any other genetic editing. 2 doses regime

[Novavax](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k1t8yw/nvxcov2373_vaccine_protects_cynomolgus_macaque/) - Subunit recombinant stabilised Spike protein w/ proprietary adjuvant. 2 doses regime

[J&J](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/i0v463/singleshot_ad26_vaccine_protects_against_sarscov2/) - Ad26 vector, stabilised Spike protein (as Novavax, BNT, Moderna etc...). **1 dose** regime

If you look at the graphs and in the summary, you can clearly see the main difference between Novavax/J&J and OX/AZ: none of the macaques in any vaccine group had lower respiratory tract infection after the challenge (meaning no pneumonia or systemic disease), but the ones immunised with OX/AZ still have upper respiratory tract infections and sgRNA shedding from the nose and mouth, meaning that *probably* the virus was still allowed to reproduce there. The macaques also showed sign of mild illness (ok, I know it is hard to ask a monkey ""do you have the cold?"" and get an actual answer, but there were some signs, like increased respiratory frequency etc...). The other two vaccines apparently granted sterilising immunity, as no monkey showed virus RNA in the swabs from the 2nd day after the challenge. This may be explained by the fact that neutralising ab levels where much higher, probably due to a better formulation of the vaccines

To me this difference look massive (assuming that the monkey trials translate directly into humans, which I know is a big **IF**), because it would mean that with the OX/AZ vaccine you can still get moderately sick and for a brief period spread the virus to others, like a cold or the flu. This would also reconcile with the Ph 3 Lancet paper where a ""mediocre"" efficiency for symptomatic COVID is presented.

If the science is solid, and we can extrapolate from here, I think many people fully expect that J&J and the others would likely be much more efficient that OX/AZ in humans for preventing both symptoms and further spread (which is the most important factor if we want the pandemic to truly end in a reasonable timeframe). The additional advantage of J&J over AZ/OX is that it is a single dose vaccine, and their own paper suggest that a booster further down the line may even improve the efficacy (as in ab levels) by 2.6-2.9 times, but the timing of the booster shot is much more lenient (so you can start giving the first dose to everyone, and months later you can offer the booster starting from the most vulnerable people). This is why they have a US test arm also for two doses, as they probably want to gather more data in parallel to be ready for everything (you can say what you want about megacorporations, but there is a reason why they are called BIG pharma.

Considering that AZ is still discussing approval with EMA/FDA due to their ""poor"" managing of the trials and J&J is so close to readout (with a much larger and diverse cohort of participants, I must add), if I was a politician/regulator/decision maker TODAY I would definitely start putting most of my chips on the latter",0,0.115,0.085,0.8,0.7351

gj88r3c,2021-01-13,"This will be a political issue. And there'll be probably a discussion on the issue.

The original motivation for many countries to impose restrictions was to preserve health care capacity and to prevent unnecessary deaths. If this is the goal, then any vaccine which prevents serious disease and death is good. Vaccinating most vulnerable people (at least everyone aged 50+) with any vaccine with this effect as quickly as possible is then the right choice. This might take 2-6 months in Western countries from today depending on where you live.

After this is done, most serious disease and death will stop. Nothing is ever perfect, so somebody will still die and somebody will be in the hospital - as they do because countless other diseases. The disease will continue circulating, but there'll be only little consequences when compared to all the other killers we've lived with for decades (cancer, particle emissions, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lifestyle disease and all existing endemic pathogenes).

There'll be a tail forever as the virus becomes endemic, but the consequences will be small in the end after most people have been protected from death and serious disease.

Then again, some people are marketing the idea of elimination or eradication. If this is the goal, then the restrictions would have to be in place until almost everyone is vaccinated with a vaccine which prevents transmission effectively - if there even is one. This might take 1-3 years from today. And still, it might not be possible. The virus might drift antigenically so that it will continue transmitting after a while. Also a new variant might arrive from any area with less than perfect vaccine protection. It won't cause serious disease due to protection gained from old variants, but it will revert the status back to the option where virus circulates but doesn't do much. 

So this is a risky proposition because it would require a long time and the payout might not even be there. The costs would also be massive: Only keeping up the testing regime which is key to controlling the spread is costly. One RT-PCR test costs around USD/EUR 100. I've had probably five to this point during the last 6 months, so that's 500 USD.

this here is the key point. Theoretically speaking I would 110% agree (as the concept of *acceptable risk* is known to me due to my specific background), but we do not live in a purely theoretical world. We unfortunately live in a society (no pun intended) which has demonstarted in the last year or so that an *infodemic* can do as much damage as a real pandemic. Maybe I am overthinking about it, but try to imagine the following: a ""good enough"" vaccine is rolled out to the vast majority of the *at risk* population (as the UK is trying to do with AZ), and slowly restrictions are lifted, mainly due to the rising pressure to return to normal. Then social contacts resume and we inevitably get an increase in the number of reported cases, even among the vaccinated parts of the populace (bc of no sterilising immunity, poor effectiveness in some cohorts or whatever else).

If the last 10 months have been an indication, I would definitely see the media feasting on this like there is no tomorrow: ""I was vaccined but I got COVID"", ""Do vaccine really work?"" ""Why is this happening?"" ""Are they hiding something?"" etc etc etc. I mean, it happened already where I live: a care home with 100+ elder ppl got the first mass shots of the Pfizer vaccine, but it turned out that one of the nurses administering the vaccines was already infected and pre-symptomatic and therefore 4-5 days later there was an outbreak in the same care home. 20+ of the people who had just got the 1st shot by this nurse were found positive (but mainly asymptomatic). The media went instantly bonkers, pages of pages of clickbaiting about absolutely nothing, until one of the heads of our NHS made a statement like ""this is normal, you need 2 doses and wait X days for protection. These ppl just got one shot a few days ago so nothing to see here, move along"". Now expand this on a nation-wide (or world-wide) scale... The repetition of these scenarios plus the amplification of such news due to social media and clickbaiting would IMHO seriously damage the whole ""reputation"" of the vaccination campaign, with bs debates on ""rushed vaccines"" taking again priority over rational scientific discussions.

## Abstract

An effective vaccine is needed to end the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Data from the U.S. NCT04368728 and German EudraCT 2020-001038-36 vaccine trials was recently reported, showing the safety, tolerability, and antibody response of the BNT162b1 vaccine candidate. BNT162b1 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain and is one of several RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates under study. Here, we report preliminary results from a Phase I trial testing BNT162b1 in 144 healthy Chinese participants. The safety profile was broadly comparable to that seen in the American and German trials, with fever the only Grade 3 adverse event reported. Prime-boost vaccination with 10 µg or 30 µg BNT162b1 induced robust antibody responses in both younger (18 to 55 years of age) and older (65 to 85) Chinese adults, and interferon-γ T-cell responses to RBD antigen challenge were significantly higher in participants receiving BNT162b1 than those in placebo groups. The 30 µg dose induced increased reactogenicity as well as a more favorable vaccine-elicited virus-neutralizing response than the 10 µg dose in both younger and older Chinese adults. In conclusion, this first report of an mRNA vaccine in an Asian population showed similar results to BNT162b1 trials.",2,0.105,0.024,0.871,0.9392

In the case of pfizer it's also not that only 5% are infected,  the endpoint sees that ~5% 7 days post second dose (28 days later) have PCR confirmed covid.  

For starters they didn't test everyone, routinely with surveillance swabs. The trials did not set out primarily to measure transmission! AZ tried the most to measure onward  transmission, and the results (in normal dose regimen at least) were substantially less than the 'net efficacy'. Efficacy != reduction in onward transmission. They don't translate one to one

Here’s a direct quote, because I have little faith you’ll actually read it. 

> Vaccination, when used during hepatitis A outbreaks, is consistently followed by a rapid decline in incidence of new cases, most likely related to reductions of secondary transmission and sub-clinical cases that play a role in maintaining the outbreak. Data from randomized trials are limited, but in a study of household contacts of individuals diagnosed with primary hepatitis A infection, vaccination was approximately 80% effective for prevention of secondary infection.

I would also have a problem if you wrote that because it's not accurate. 


You've made it clear in multiple other threads that you believe the covid vaccine will completely prevent infection and transmission (at least completely corresponding with the published 
 efficacy) I explained why the reduction in transmission is likely to be less than the efficacy.  Something which the Moderna data you cite also backs up 

You've repeatedly suggested anyone who suggests infection or tranmission is possible post vaccination is posting misinformation and suggested in the last covid-19 thread you commented in people were 'scientifically illiterate' . 

You are the one posting misinformation. There is no firm evidence to suggest any covid vaccine will completely prevent transmission. Some data is out on AZ trial; one that actually set out to measure impact on asymptomatic transmission-- it  found a 4% net reduction. Can that fairly be advertised as prevention of transmission to the public in good faith? I don't think so. 

You have claimed multiple times it is the mainstream prediction of scientists that transmission will be prevented. You've stated that ""any"" virologist or ""immunologist"" supports your opinion, despite I can find half a dozen in 10 minutes that disagree. 

I asked you for evidence or source on that statement multiple times..  it was quiet, no backtalk. I gave you plenty of sources upon your request, but you provided nothing apart from insinuating I hadn't read this OP FAQ. I have, I've also read the Moderna trial this guy who compiled the FAQ bases his writings on. . It doesn't even support that statement fully, and it's certainly not an indication of consensus thought on this topic.

I have no idea why you're making this so complicated.  I simply responded to you once to explain why it is not misinformation to suggest transmission may be possible in a post vaccinated world

What I stated was not wrong. It is not controversial or crazy or shocking. But you argued with it and downvoted and now we're here half a dozen comments later because clearly you disagree and think my position is insane. 

If you mean to say reduce and not prevent then just say you meant to say reduce, you don't need to try and spin it around on me attacking you over semantics, I just want correct information to be posted here.  I won't hold it against you I'll just say ok fair enough I understand what you meant. I just dont want people reading your comments and getting misled or having false hope thinking it's scientific fact when it's not.

Yeah nice try,  but if you actually find my quote I say typically intramuscular vaccines are not 100% effective at reducing onward transmission  and what you quote below supports my statement exactly.

Are you kidding me? You use an old quote re: AZs trial stating that the expectation  transmission *might* be **reduced**  (not prevented) but that data is not available yet- and as some kind of proof ?

You know this data has been published now? , I mentioned it above -- the effects on reducing onward transmission were not exactly stellar.. although the reduction was higher in the LD/SD regimen it was  4% in the SD/SD regimen. **In both cases it was substantially less than published efficacy **

And thats important to stress because a number of times you have said if the vaccine is 95 efficacious transmission or infection will be reduced by the same amount. That is not the case. I did give just a few reasons why already. 

If you think it's reasonable to go around telling people that vaccines ""prevent"" transmission for a 4% reduction  then that's up to you, but I will call it out and say that it's fair to suggest transmission may be possible 

in the same manner I would call out someone saying a birth control pill prevents pregnancies if it was only demonstrated in one purpose designed clinical trial to reduce by 4% - I would state pregnancies may be possible.

**Background** Vaccination is crucial to address the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine hesitancy could undermine control efforts. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK population, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for vaccine hesitancy.

**Methods** Nationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the ‘Understanding Society’ COVID-19 web survey. Participants were asked how likely or unlikely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models conducted.

**Findings** Overall intention to be vaccinated was high (82% likely/very likely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and less educated (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was particularly high in Black (71.8%), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%), Mixed (32.4%) and non-UK/Irish White (26.4%) ethnic groups. Fully adjusted models showed gender, education and ethnicity were independently associated with vaccine hesitancy. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 12.96 (95% CI:7.34, 22.89) in the Black/Black British and 2.31 (95% CI:1.55, 3.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish ethnicity) and 3.24 (95%CI:1.93, 5.45) for people with no qualifications compared to degree educated. The main reason for hesitancy was fears over unknown future effects.

gjubh7y,2021-01-17,"Obviously you haven't read much on the topic. Well congratulations, you're [one of the lucky 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)!

The exclusion of pregnant women from clinical trials is 1) not always a good thing, and 2) is subject to quite a bit of discussion and reconsideration these days. 

Regarding 1), that it could be a bad idea sometimes should make sense to you. If a life-saving drug is safe for pregnant women, but is never found to be safe due to pregnant women's exclusion from clinical trials and as such not recommended for pregnant women, they can die. With pregnant women's susceptibility to further complications if they do develop severe respiratory issues as a result of infection, frankly the vaccine would be very important for them. You also have the alternative problem, where pregnant women are prescribed treatments of medication that *do* pose a risk to their child, as there had been zero evidence of any risk because they hadn't been included in clinical trials. 

Regarding 2), this is not a done deal in terms of medical ethics and is subject to ongoing debate. Your comparison of the medical inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials as being as of ""the arse end of Russia"", or having ""a penchant for Nazi Germany"", and your statement that including them in clinical trials is ""to use them as lab rats"", are a bit facile. 

As an example, see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186443/), with its following excerpt from the conclusions; 

>There is much to be learned about how to treat pregnant women with health problems effectively and safely and how to prevent poor pregnancy outcomes. This is the type of useful knowledge that clinical research should provide, yet there remains an unhealthy reluctance to involve pregnant women in clinical trials, a legacy of decades. There remains a need for more regulatory clarity, for example, what is minimal risk to the fetus. The legal liability concerns continue to challenge the clinical research efforts, yet the clinical research examples presented at the workshop demonstrate efforts to ensure that pregnant women benefit from clinical research so that ultimately we have the knowledge needed to help pregnant women be healthy and to ensure that healthy fetuses and healthy babies have healthy mothers.

Or [this article](https://peh-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13010-019-0081-8), with the following excerpt; 

>While the objections (to including pregnant women) may be valid, **not performing research magnifies what should be a carefully controlled risk during research**, pushing this risk into the clinical setting, and subsequently posing a challenge to clinicians who are faced with making treatment decisions for pregnant patients with limited evidence of efficacy and safety. 

Or [this article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X2030484-8/fulltext) relating to pregnant women and COVID-19 treatments, finding that ~75% of trials listed pregnancy as an exclusion criteria, with the following excerpts; 

>Exclusion was not well justified as many of the treatments being evaluated have no or low safety concerns during pregnancy. Inclusion of pregnant women in clinical treatment trials is urgently needed to identify effective COVID-19 treatment for this population. 

And

>The ongoing exclusion of pregnant women from therapeutic trials for COVID-19 will result in missed opportunities to identify efficacious and safe treatments to prevent adverse maternal, pregnancy, and birth outcomes. Consideration of the risks and benefits of inclusion should not preclude participation of pregnant women in clinical treatment trials.

There's also the fact that pregnant women, like any other adult, possess the basic faculties to weigh and assess risks and benefits both for themselves and on behalf of their child, making them no more lab rats than any other participant. Pregnancy does not entail an inability to consent. 

So to summarise;

1) including pregnant women in clinical trials is a good idea because their exclusion gives us two possibilities;   
a) Pregnant women cannot access safe and effective treatment because it is not proven safe for them in clinical trials  
b) Pregnant women are prescribed unsafe treatment because it is not proven unsafe  for them in clinical trials  

2) That they should be included in clinical trials is a fairly mainstream belief in medical ethics.

To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.",17,0.051,0.055,0.895,-0.6428

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant now seen in 50 countries. In addition, many countries are extending the interval between doses of vaccine is being extended in order to expand vaccine coverage. It is unclear whether real world neutralising antibody titres will follow those in clinical trials, particularly in elderly persons, and how this will be impacted by mutations in strains such as B1.1.7. Here we tested immune responses in patients 3 weeks following the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2. We also tested neutralising antibody responses against pseudoviruses expressing wild type Spike proteins or expressing 3 key mutations present in B.1.1.7 (deletion 69/70, N501Y, A570D). IgG Spike antibody titres correlated well with neutralisation. We observed a range of neutralisation titres against wild type, with geometric mean titre (GMT) of 24. The vaccine sera exhibited a range of inhibitory dilutions giving 50% neutralisation (ID50) from <1:4 to 3449. However a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved threshold neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 years old (8/15 versus 8/8 P=0.052) after the first dose. Neutralisation titres were not significantly impacted by the combination of three Spike mutations tested, but were reduced against the full set of Spike mutations present in the B.1.1.7 variant. The highest fold change was approxiamately 6 and the median fold change for the B.1.1.7 variant versus wild type was 3.85 (IQR 2.68-5.28).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.

Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2.

This vaccine takes a rabies virus and modifies it so it will have the coronavirus spike protein on its surface. Then they deactivate the virus and use it to make the vaccine. So the spike protein is already in the vaccine, it doesn't need to make the cells in your body produce it.

Someone who gets this vaccine will develop antibodies to both the rabies virus and the coronavirus, possibly protective levels for both. That could be handy in countries where the general population is at risk of rabies exposure - this vaccine might kill two birds with one stone.

These include: expressible spike genes in genome, spike and envelope epitopes as surface decorations, and nucleocapsid proteins in packaged core. Phage decorated with spike trimers is found to be the most potent vaccine candidate in mouse and rabbit models. Without any adjuvant, this vaccine stimulated robust immune responses, both TH1 and TH2 IgG subclasses, blocked virus-receptor interactions, neutralized viral infection, and conferred complete protection against viral challenge.

# They Pledged to Donate Rights to Their COVID Vaccine, Then Sold Them to Pharma [https://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/](https://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/)  

Oxford University surprised and pleased advocates of overhauling the  vaccine business in April by promising to donate the rights to its  promising coronavirus vaccine to any drugmaker.

The idea was to provide medicines preventing or treating COVID-19 at a low cost or free of charge, [the British university said](https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/technologies-available/technology-licensing/expedited-access-covid-19-related-ip/).  That made sense to people seeking change. The coronavirus was raging.  Many agreed that traditional vaccine development, characterized by long  lead times, manufacturing monopolies and weak investment, was broken.

“We actually thought they were going to do that,” James Love,  director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that works to  expand access to medical technology, said of Oxford’s pledge. “Why  wouldn’t people agree to let everyone have access to the best vaccines  possible?”

A few weeks later, Oxford—urged on by the Bill & Melinda Gates  Foundation—reversed course. It signed an exclusive vaccine deal with  AstraZeneca that gave the pharmaceutical giant sole rights and no  guarantee of low prices—with the less-publicized potential for Oxford to  eventually make millions from the deal and win plenty of prestige.

> A preliminary report from the Clalit Research Institute compared the infection data of 200 000 people aged 60 and over who were not vaccinated with the infection data of 200 000 people of the same age group who received one vaccine dose and were monitored for at least 11 days from the date of vaccination. On day 14 there was a “significant decrease of about 33% in the rate of positive tests for the coronavirus” among those who had been vaccinated. This decrease remained the same between days 15 and 17. 

> The report has raised concerns, as published results have suggested that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine was 52.4% between the first and second dose (spaced 21 days apart), and data assessed by Public Health England indicated it could be as much as 89% protective from day 15 to 21.

This study is based on who *caught* the virus, based on testing, irrespective of whether they had a bad course of disease. The vaccines are about preventing the disease, not infections. It also looks at data in a relative brief window, up to day 17.

It's just that Pfizer and Moderna chose the short 21 and 28 days for that interval out of experimental expediency because it is the shortest time to get a two shot boost; not because it is known to be the optimal time.

But it sure seems like we could stretch the interval between shots out to 60 or 80 days perhaps to cover more people in the next two months and potentially get some benefit from partial herd immunity or broader coverage in a vulnerable group.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100μg of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays.

>**Abstract**

>**Background**

>BNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomized controlled phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days. 

>**Methods**

>We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2.6 million-member state-mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.

>**Findings**

>Data of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59.7 years SD=14.7, 47.8% males) were analyzed, of whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0.27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51.4% relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 43.41-per-100,000(SE=12.07) in days 1-12 to 21.08-per-100,000(SE=6.16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling H. pylori-bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. 16-20 months-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD-nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD-nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious viruses in nasal washes and lungs as well as viral RNA in respiratory organs.

A single vaccine dose elicited high levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific binding and neutralizing antibodies; following intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, animals were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs.

glqt7yj,2021-02-02,">**Background:** The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the UK regulatory authority, MHRA, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of between 4 and 12 weeks. The planned rollout in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.

>**Methods**: We present data from phase III efficacy trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the United Kingdom and Brazil, and phase I/II clinical trials in the UK and South Africa, against symptomatic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The data cut-off date for these analyses was 7th December 2020. The accumulated cases of COVID-19 disease at this cut-off date exceeds the number required for a pre-specified final analysis, which is also presented. As previously described, individuals over 18 years of age were randomised 1:1 to receive two standard doses (SD) of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5x1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine/saline placebo. In the UK trial efficacy cohort a subset of participants received a lower dose (LD, 2.2x1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. All cases with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis, by a blinded independent endpoint review committee. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674.

>**Findings:** 17,177 baseline seronegative trial participants were eligible for inclusion in the efficacy analysis, 8948 in the UK, 6753 in Brazil and 1476 in South Africa, with 619 documented NAAT +ve infections of which 332 met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection >14 days post dose 2.The primary analysis of overall vaccine efficacy >14 days after the second dose including LD/SD and SD/SD groups, based on the prespecified criteria was 66.7% (57.4%,  74.0%). There were no hospitalisations in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21 day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group.Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination was 76% (59%, 86%), and modelled analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3 month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 day (GMR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59, 0.74).In the SD/SD group, after the second dose, efficacy was higher with a longer prime-boost interval: VE 82.4% 95%CI 62.7%, 91.7% at 12+ weeks, compared with VE 54.9%, 95%CI 32.7%, 69.7% at <6 weeks. These observations are supported by immunogenicity data which showed binding antibody responses more than 2-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with and interval of less than 6 weeks GMR 2.19 (2.12, 2.26) in those who were 18-55 years of age.

A key point, that I think is worth emphasising is despite the focus on short term risk, weighing up longer term is that 'risk in the distance' is essentially reduced  by vaccinating faster and vaccinating with a longer dose interval that confers net stronger/more durable protection. That's something often ignored when this topic comes up

Further snippets from the paper,  

> The risks of developing vaccine escape variants are different from the risk associated with therapeutics. **Vaccines overall are less vulnerable to pathogen evolution** because of differences in the way drugs and vaccines work. 

a. Vaccines are used to prevent infection whilst (most) drugs are used to treat 
established infections. **This means that the opportunities for resistant variants 
to emerge under within-host selection from vaccines are many orders of 
magnitude smaller than for drugs.**

b. Secondly, in immunocompetent hosts the immune response continues to 
evolve during a single infection. 

c. Thirdly vaccines produce responses from several arms of the immune 
response against many targets on a pathogen, whilst drugs target 
comparatively fewer sites.

> For many infectious diseases, **it has been possible to drive them to the verge of extinction, and hold them there for decades using vaccines, without vaccine escape mutations emerging** Nevertheless, viral variation requiring changes in vaccines does occur –most notably requiring the annual adjustment of influenza vaccines. **Although it should be noted that the antigenic variation of influenza is not driven by vaccine use but by immunity following natural infection.**

glseagh,2021-02-02,"
You're welcome. And at least imho, yes, in context of the other points, especially comparing the alternate scenario (infections rife in the community with only some level of natural immunity) 

It's important to keep in mind when looking at the vaccine data presented--  to use pfizer for example, because people often cite that to argue against the low '52%' single dose protection;  the 95% efficacy of two dose regimen only counts infections occuring 7 days post dose 2. It disregards any infections occuring in preceding 28 days. Whereas the 52% number starts counting from day one. Most infections in the pfizer trial (or any vaccine trial) occured in the first 21 days, and especially in the first ~12-14 days before the vaccine kicked in, you can see from cumulative incidence it barely deviated from placebo till the. 

 Measuring the one dose and two dose with same criteria (disregarding early cases before immunity kicked in properly) and you'll see they are both similar, the first dose provides the bulk of protection, that's the rationale why UK extended dose interval on Pfizer too. 

The measurements of naturally induced 'efficacy' against SC2, are not taken at intervals of 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, but if we had a large enough sample size of people voluntarily exposed to covid and we were to measure and compare their incidence rates of positive tests vs control like we do with vaccines at later time periods we would likely observe a similar pattern, that protection increases over time and infections are not immediately prevented.

We see severe cases typically have stronger AB response than mild, and we see typically stronger response in vaccines vs convalescent sera. 

Overall despite that some have raised concerns about 'parallel evolution' arising to take advantage of immune escape once certain level of population immunity is reached (naturally or vaccinated) that's something that if true may come up at some point regardless, and for now, whatever the reason has come up without significant  presence of vaccine induced pressure

 we know we will see less infections (and less transmissions from said infections) the faster we can vaccinate people, (which can be done at a higher rate than natural infections, --e.g in UK 16,000 reported PCR infections, 350,000 vaccinations from today's data.

 And finally we know vaccine derived immunity associates with much less of mortality burden as a bonus, so it makes sense to not obsess too much about those future risks, but be cautious and plan for them,  and in the meantime just vaccinate as many as possible whilst limiting chances of spread, e.g via lockdowns. The 10% reduction or whatever in like-for-like efficacy that you get between dose one and dose two can't offset vaccinating 50% or 100% more people in the meantime as a result of delayed doses, and it especially doesn't make sense if vaccinating faster result in net lower or less durable protection 

In theory, the cumulative effect of reduced transmission and infection and lockdowns whilst they occur, perhaps combined with seasonal effects may be enough to massively reduce spread within borders of countries that have vaccinated quickly, we have already seen in northern hemisphere much lower cases in summer, and there seems to be early clues this is happening now

If it plays out like, new variants aside that that then overall reduces the chance of mutation compared to dragged out periods of natural infection, including in immunocompromised hosts",10,0.097,0.054,0.849,0.9814

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial.

>**Methods**

>We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0·5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396).

>**Findings**

>Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0·1%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1·3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91·6% (95% CI 85·6–95·2).

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant now seen in 50 countries. It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2. We measured neutralising antibody responses following a single immunization using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 mutations found in the B.1.1.7 Spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses (<1:4 to 3449) that were reduced against B.1.1.7 variant by 3.85 fold (IQR 2.68-5.28). This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralization was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) (5 outof 29), but not in neutralizing mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background led to a further loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. Further work is needed to establish the impact of these observations on protective vaccine efficacy in the context of the evolving B.1.1.7 lineage that will likely acquire E484K.",2,0.007,0.043,0.949,-0.714

Vaccines remains the key protective measure to achieve herd immunity to control the disease burden and stop COVID-19 pandemic. We have developed and assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two formulations (1mg and 2mg) of ZyCoV-D (a plasmid DNA based vaccine candidates) administered through Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) and syringe-needle (intradermal) in rhesus macaques with three dose vaccine regimens. The vaccine candidate 2mg dose administered using Needle Free Injection System (NFIS) elicited a significant immune response with development of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike region specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers during the immunization phase and significant enhancement in the levels after the virus challenge. In 2 mg NFIS group the IgG and NAb titers were maintained and showed gradual rise during the immunization period (15 weeks) and till 2 weeks after the virus challenge. It also conferred better protection to macaques evident by the viral clearance from nasal swab, throat swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens in comparison with macaques from other immunized groups. In contrast, the animals from placebo group developed high levels of viremia and lung disease following the virus challenge. Besides this, the vaccine candidate also induced increase lymphocyte proliferation and cytokines response (IL-6, IL-5).The administration of the vaccine candidate with NFIS generated a better immunogenicity response in comparison to syringe-needle (intradermal route).

A distinctive feature of the roll out of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the UK was the decision to delay the timing of the second injection till 12 weeks after the first. The logic behind this is to protect more people sooner and so reduce the total number of severe infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. This decision caused criticism from some quarters due in part to a belief that a single injection may not give adequate immunity. A recent paper based on Israel s experience of vaccination suggested that a single dose may not provide adequate protection. Here we extract the primary data from the Israeli paper and then estimate the incidence per day for each day after the first injection and also estimate vaccine effectiveness for each day from day 13 to day 24. We used a pooled estimate of the daily incidence rate during days 1 to 12 as the counterfactual estimate of incidence without disease and estimated confidence intervals using Monte Carlo modelling. After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off. The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. What our analysis shows is that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to 21 days to achieve this. The early results coming from Israel support the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.",36,0.041,0.045,0.914,0.2235

glx4103,2021-02-03,Some interesting stuff here. Their data indicates that the vaccine becomes “less effective” a few days after the vaccine compared to the first day after the dose. Probably just because of people changing behavior after the first shot and it skews their conclusion in my opinion. The Pfizer phase 3 data did not show this effect and in fact showed solid immunity at 12-14 days after first dose. Pfizer also used symptoms and a positive pcr test as an indicator of a positive test. We know incubation period is a few days on average so those who developed symptoms on day 10 for example were likely infected a few days before. Am I right in thinking immunity is likely more than what this paper suggests 10-14 days after the first dose? I don’t have it on hand but moderna’s phase 3 data also showed good protection 10-14 days after the first dose and I don’t see how the two mRNA vaccines would cause much different of an immune response.,16,0.092,0.012,0.896,0.9081

After then the effectiveness levelled off, and case numbers became quite low.  

The analysis covers days 1-24 after first dose, so it ""levels"" off for 4 days.

So, with your example. Assume you will be getting 500 doses every week, starting 3 weeks after the first 2000 people were vaccinated. Who do you use it on?

**If you use the doses on the people already vaccinated you will have:**

*Day 0: 1000 people receive first dose*

Days 77+ All patients at 95% immunity

Total average immunity: 62.14% immunity  

&#x200B;

**Now, change the dosing to first dose first for the town, this results in some patients waiting two additional weeks. All the data is the same until Day 21:**

*Day 21: 500 people receive first dose*

Days 21-27: 1000 people 91% immunity, 500 people 34% immunity, 500 people 0% immunity: Average immunity 54% (was 45.5%)

Days 77+ All patients at 95% immunity (was 95%)

&#x200B;

**TL/DR:** 

Using a first dose first methodology gets the town to various immunity thresholds two weeks earlier (e.g. day 42 vs. day 56 to reach 90% average immunity) and has 8.5%-27.5% increases in average immunity from day 21 through day 55. These differences would be significant in a town this size with not much risk.

Critics of the first dose first methodology say there is little data after day 21 for Pfizer (and day 28 for Moderna). While the original study called for vaccinations at day 21, some patients did not follow the protocol strictly and so there is some data after and the authors of a separate analysis of the data [here (page 5)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949505/annex-a-phe-report-to-jcvi-on-estimated-efficacy-of-single-vaccine-dose.pdf) felt comfortable saying the data were strong through day 28. 

Even if you assume that the efficacy falls off by 10% after day 28, it would not impact the example above significantly. Declines of \~25-30% would begin to impact the decision, although that seems unlikely in the two week delay contemplated for some of the patients here. Delays of a few months cause these kinds of declines -- and I'm not in favor of anything like that -- but delaying 2-5 weeks past the recommended interval doesn't seem too risky for the potential benefit.",10,0.028,0.004,0.968,0.932
glzgzlx,2021-02-04,"I think it's probably expected that a heterologous prime boost (what is being tested here) would increase levels of immunity, and we would expect to see better immunological data (eg. more antibodies produced) from the experiment, certainly against a single dose but perhaps even against a homologous prime boost (IE 2 of the same vaccine).  


The reason you may expect this is that using multiple mechanisms will elicit more ways for the  immune system to responsd compared to just one. Additionally in the case of vector vaccines (eg. Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine), the prime boost should not be affected by vector immunity.  


We have some data for this already with the Sputnik V vaccine which despite being being a viral vector vaccine shows higher efficacy than the other 2 viral vector vaccines we have phase 3 data for (AZ/Oxford and J&J, although the latter is only a single dose). Sputnik V uses two different vectors in their vaccination schedule to avoid vector immunity but also potentially produce a wider immune response.  


However, as with lots of things in immunology you need to do the experiment to actually find out if your theories match up with the data.",11,0.102,0.013,0.884,0.9405

## Abstract

A vaccine, when available, will likely become our best tool to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, vaccine shortages will likely occur. Using an age-stratified mathematical model paired with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for four different metrics (deaths, symptomatic infections, and maximum non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations) under many scenarios. We find that a vaccine with effectiveness ≥50% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age-groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age-groups first for high vaccination coverage. While there are other societal and ethical considerations, this work can provide an evidence-based rationale for vaccine prioritization.",5,0.133,0.022,0.845,0.9565

## Abstract

Limited initial supply of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. Here, we used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20-49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults over 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. While maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.",1,0.048,0.033,0.919,0.4491

The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied.

Both natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and immunization with a number of vaccines induce protective immunity. However, the ability of such immune responses to recognize and therefore protect against emerging variants is a matter of increasing importance. Such variants of concern (VOC) include isolates of lineage B1.1.7, first identified in the UK, and B1.351, first identified in South Africa. Our data confirm that VOC, particularly those with substitutions at residues 484 and 417 escape neutralization by antibodies directed to the ACE2-binding Class 1 and the adjacent Class 2 epitopes but are susceptible to neutralization by the generally less potent antibodies directed to Class 3 and 4 epitopes on the flanks RBD. To address this potential threat, we sampled a SARS-CoV-2 uninfected UK cohort recently vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, two doses delivered 18-28 days apart), alongside a cohort naturally infected in the first wave of the epidemic in Spring 2020. We tested antibody and T cell responses against a reference isolate (VIC001) representing the original circulating lineage B and the impact of sequence variation in these two VOCs. We identified a reduction in antibody neutralization against the VOCs which was most evident in the B1.351 variant. However, the majority of the T cell response was directed against epitopes conserved across all three strains. The reduction in antibody neutralization was less marked in post-boost vaccine-induced than in naturally-induced immune responses and could be largely explained by the potency of the homotypic antibody response. However, after a single vaccination, which induced only modestly neutralizing homotypic antibody titres, neutralization against the VOCs was completely abrogated in the majority of vaccinees. These data indicate that VOCs may evade protective neutralising responses induced by prior infection, and to a lesser extent by immunization, particularly after a single vaccine, but the impact of the VOCs on T cell responses appears less marked. The results emphasize the need to generate high potency immune responses through vaccination in order to provide protection against these and other emergent variants. We observed that two doses of vaccine also induced a significant increase in binding antibodies to spike of both SARS-CoV-1 & MERS, in addition to the four common coronaviruses currently circulating in the UK. The impact of antigenic imprinting on the potency of humoral and cellular heterotypic protection generated by the next generation of variant-directed vaccines remains to be determined.",31,0.071,0.038,0.891,0.705

I think this another instance where the precise language of science gets misinterpreted by the general public. To the layman, ""significant"" means large, substantial, even massive. Most of the general public would find it confusing to hear something described as ""small but significant."" 


>The comparatively modest effects of the mutations on viral sensitivity to plasma reflects the polyclonal nature of the neutralizing antibodies in vaccinee plasma. Nevertheless, emergence of these particular
variants is consistent with the dominance of the class 1 and 2 antibody
response in infected or vaccinated individuals. We speculate that these
mutations emerged in response to immune selection in individuals with
non-sterilizing immunity. What the long-term effect of accumulation
of mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be is not known, but the
common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E evolves antigenic variants that
are comparatively resistant to the older sera but remain sensitive to
contemporaneous sera49. Thus, it is possible that these mutations and
others that emerge in individuals with suboptimal or waning immunity
will erode the effectiveness of natural and vaccine elicited immunity.
The data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibody therapies
may need to be updated and immunity monitored in order to compensate for viral evolution.

This all continues to suggest that vaccines will struggle to provide truly neutralizing immunity, but should remain effective against severe disease and death. Seems likely we will need periodic booster shots as well. Not ideal but very far from the doomsday that some are crowing about.",23,0.091,0.099,0.81,-0.7553

It would take much more time and people in a human trial with a control group to truly assess how much protection is conferred. This is difficult because in practice you can't isolate a variant like that and it gets messy when people's behavior is involved as well. For example, maybe a vaccine had better ""numbers"" as you put it in the US because its more effective against our circulating variants, or maybe it was better because the US has more people double masking and social distancing, leading to lower viral loads in those exposed and because the exposure was less the antibodies neutralized it and they never tested positive. Or a million other potential tiny variables like that. There are a lot of variables that make this type of study really challenging. By running these serum tests they know that humans are producing X amount of immune response, and it would appear that response is more than enough to prevent severe disease and death in the VOCs, which is really the goal here.

Johnson & Johnson and Novavax also had parts of their clinical trials in South Africa. They both also reported lower efficacy against the South African strain, but in the 57-60% range, not as low as Oxford/AstraZeneca.

But all of these efficacy numbers against the South Africa strain need to be taken with a large grain of salt. They come from a smaller sample size than the full clinical trial, and they also come from a country that was already hit pretty hard by the original strain (if partial protection due to prior infection with the original strain reduces the number of cases of the new strain in the unvaccinated control group, it can make efficacy estimates come out too low).

The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro. Taken together, these data highlight the efficacy of the RBD-NP formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in promoting robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.",1,0.074,0.0,0.926,0.9186

gn332e8,2021-02-12,"This is the university of Witwatersrand study that was crumbed over the media in piecemeal screenshots the past weeks. 

The authors have elaborated on some possible caveats that had been pointed out during the speculation phase of this preprints release; Most notably highlighting the potential possibility of T-Cells to protect against severe disease (severe disease not encountered in the study demographic and sample size not powered well to determine)

The authors also mentioned at least what was my personal biggest critique in the media reporting of this study--  the resulting comparison to J&J's better sounding results (which were based on unidentical case definitions)

> Another recent multi-national study inclusive of South Africa, evaluated efficacy of a single dose of the Janssen non-replicating adenovirus type 26 vaccine (Ad26-vaccine). Interim results from the  South African arm reported VE of 54% against **moderate-severe** and 85% against severe Covid-19 mainly due to B.1.351 variant.

> **The Ad26-vaccine study, however, only submitted NAAT confirmed cases that had at least three symptoms for endpoint adjudication land consequently the VE 
analyses likely excludes the majority of mild Covid-19 in the study.** Notably, the immunogenicity of Ad26-vaccine is similar to that of ChAdOx1-nCoV19 following the first dose and after the second dose

For reference in this study of AZ, a fever OR cough *alone* could be counted as mild case; and 2/3rds of cases were mild. 

B1351 was detected in SA in October, J&J modified the trial protocol in Oct and again in December; they presented efficacy stats on moderate-severe cases only -- this makes a like for like comparison against AZ harder in this context.

https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol

 I think it's intuitive the two are more similar in terms of ""net efficacy""  than has been reported, if they were to be measured more equally with appropriate sample size;  especially when considering the data presented in this study shows even one dose efficacy of AZ at 72/75%  pre-arrival of B1351.  Hoping the  upcoming J&J FDA review will provide a bit more transparency on J&J distribution of mild cases. 

But at the moment, it looks like neither one dose of AZ given only few weeks later or one dose of J&J period are getting the most out of what these vaccines could do against B135 in altered configurations and those are the main vaccine SA has at it's disposal right now 

Therefore would  be interesting to see a repeat of this study with a booster of AZ 12 weeks later ( this study used 21-35 days which has been demonstrated to give subpar AB response, and is under what EMA  and especially JCVI/STIKO/WHO recommends as dose intervals.)

 Studies show 2 fold increase observed switching from 6 weeks to 12 weeks, 3 fold from 4 weeks. As far as I'm aware based on reports this is what is going to be done in SA with a stepped rollout of 100,000 individuals receiving AZ with longer dose interval while J&J is used as the main going forward as one dose. 

Results of ENSEMBLE2 should come out in time to help inform their campaign,  given the earlier promising data on 8 week boost interval giving multiple fold increase in titres; it's more likely than not for that to generate good data over one dose.   Assuming regulatory approval,  SA could then be in a position to boost protection of those that have received one dose prior and situation would be more optimistic.",26,0.084,0.013,0.903,0.9928

**Background**

Assessing safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in different populations is essential, as is investigation of efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

**Methods**

We conducted a randomized multicentre, double blinded controlled trial on safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1-nCoV19 in HIV-uninfected people in South Africa. Participants age 18 to <65 years randomized (1:1) to two doses of vaccine containing 5x1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9%NaCl) 21-35 days apart. Post 2nd-dose serum samples (n=25) were tested by pseudotyped (PSVNA) and live virus (LVNA) neutralization assays against the D614G and B.1.351 variants. Primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) >14 days following second dose against laboratory confirmed symptomatic Covid-19.

**Results**

2026 HIV-uninfected adults were enrolled between June 24th and Nov 9th, 2020; 1010 and 1011 received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Median age was 31 years. The B.1.351 variant showed increased resistance to vaccinee sera using the PSVNA and LVNA. In the primary endpoint analysis, 23/717 (3.2%) placebo and 19/750 (2.5%) vaccine recipients developed mild-moderate Covid-19; VE 21.9% (95%Confidence Interval: -49.9; 59.8). Of the primary endpoint cases, 39/42 (92.9%) were the B.1.351 variant; against which VE was 10.4% (95%CI: -76.8; 54.8) analyzed as a secondary objective. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.

Abstract

Background

Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-<55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response.

Results

Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57.

Conclusions

Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 ug mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

gnvqp7x,2021-02-17,"The strategy has to do with vaccine availability. If after two weeks from the first, efficacy is 92%, then postponing the 2nd so that more people get the 1st would have a better outcome for the population as a whole.",19,0.068,0.035,0.896,0.34
gnw4z8z,2021-02-17,"I think you are misrepresenting many peoples position on this matter.

The first main argument is that the first dose appears to be 100% protective against death, which should be the primary endpoint. COVID is a problem because it spreads fast and is severe. Take away the severity and COVID is not much of a problem. The thought experiment here that is most useful is imagine you have 2 elderly parents >70 years old. You only have 2 doses. Would you chose to give one to each (protecting both from death) of give two to one person, leaving the other vulnerable.

The second main argument, to use your preferred numbers, is that 2x0.69 is larger protection than 0.89, so at a population scale one dose gets to herd immunity much faster.

The final one is basically that we have lots of data on vaccines generally, covid immune responses in recovered patients, and COVID vaccines at this point, and the most likely answer is that delaying a second dose would likely increase the efficacy AND protection is likely to last over 6 months from the first dose. This is because longer spreading is generally helpful in vaccine boosters, is helpful for the Astrazeneca covid vaccine, data on the single dose J&J trial and recovered patients both suggest good long term responses.

The main argument against it is ""we don't have a RCT showing it."" Sure. We don't have RCTs for lots of things, for example we don't know how protective it is against the Ohio varient. It's possible that delaying the first dose would be a bad idea, but not likely. Probably like 1% chance it's worse, 9% chance it's the same, but about 90% chance it's better. Prioritizing the second dose is the riskier choice here.",6,0.077,0.09,0.833,-0.6256
gnvuhib,2021-02-17,"If the risks you are proposing is heightened possibility of escape variants, which seems to be an unlikely scenario ( the paper below directly explores the possibility of escape variants resulting from longer dose intervals)

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/954990/s1015-sars-cov-2-immunity-escape-variants.pdf

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.2562

 Anyhow, if this is what you propose on the other side you would also have to also consider that not vaccinating someone (because their first dose is reserved for another person's booster) results in that same hypothesized risk existing, actually to a higher degree especially in a period of heightened spread. In the northern hemisphere, we should be under less pressure in terms of vaccinating quickly in the spring/summer months and In theory could afford to vaccinate slower 

But as the SAGE document above touches on, it could be that delayed interval results in net improved (or more durable protection), which would actually *reduce* the risk of what you propose in the long-run

Certainly this is the case for AZ. It's a false economy to boost one, two, three weeks after dose one with the astra vaccine. For pfizer, this is yet unknown--  of course the protection from a 3 week boost interval (with most of the heavy lifting arguably done by the first dose) is already high and it therefore has a more limited ceiling, but it's not outside the realm of possibility that durability could be boosted with longer interval, typically the more optimal time to boost is seen timing it when T-cell response fade. 

Also, I think more importantly even if the one dose efficacy *is* lower than 92%-- let's assume the more pessimistic lower CI pegging it around 70%-- its still in similar ballpark to others, e.g J&J, So if we have a problem with the idea of one dose pfizer with ~70% efficacy being a partially effective ""mutant creating"" strategy then why would we simultaneously have no issue with vaccinating with J&J or AZ or so on? 

As to the idea that immunity could fade, we know it does wane, but doesn't just stop working when it does.  It's likely more important for older people to receive second dose sooner; as some papers have hinted at, but still overall we have ample data from natural infected groups, smaller samples that had delayed boosters in trials (e.g in pfizer trial some got second dose 6 weeks later) and also data from prior vaccines to imagine the idea that people en masse would become  unprotected after several weeks is to put it mildly, unlikely. 

I mean we don't see the people who received one dose of J&J months ago all becoming reinfected; there's no real basis for that occuring here either after say 6-7 weeks post first shot awaiting the second, It might be novel vaccine tech but our immunological system while not perfectly mapped out is understood enough for us to consider this scenario unlikely.",12,0.091,0.089,0.82,0.4401

As the EU vaccine project failed, all EU countries are now vaccine deprived. This hits the EU extremely hard as the average age is among the world's highest and thus the potential for death is very high.

This has lead to the situation where some EU countries are already adapting the 12 week interval schedule for all vaccines to protect as many people as they can from death and serious disease.

They're probably making the right choice since the alternative is to vaccinate half as many people during the winter as the disease rages probably hardest.

There's already talks of extending the second dose even further if the shortage continues. It is possible that if the protection lasts strong until 12 weeks, it may last longer. However, more data is needed.

The vaccine manufacturers have again promised to supply more vaccines for EU April, but there's no guarantee that this will happen. It seems likely the botched vaccine supply agreements made by the EU countries resulted in ""EU last, always"" situations with many manufacturers.

Some EU countries might make decisions to delay the dosing even beyond the 12 weeks in April, if the horrific situation continues and there's some science to back that decision.

The current situation is that for example US and UK are at 3-5x vaccination rates compared to EU. In EU countries most people in 80+ age groups are still unprotected and dying. Countries like Chile and maybe even Russia are overtaking EU in vaccine coverage, which wasn't maybe expected.

Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS- CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild- type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses.

nih.gov: [Mapping Which Coronavirus Variants Will Resist Antibody Treatments](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/receptor-binding-domain/)

>Posted on February 9th, 2021

>You may have heard about the new variants of SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus that causes COVID-19—that have appeared in other parts of the world and have now been detected in the United States...While researchers take a closer look, it’s already possible in the laboratory to predict which mutations will help SARS-CoV-2 evade our therapies and vaccines, and even to prepare for the emergence of new mutations before they occur. In fact, an NIH-funded study...has done exactly that.

>The work...focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD), a key region of the spike protein that studs SARS-CoV-2’s outer surface. The virus uses RBD to anchor itself to the ACE2 receptor of human cells before infecting them. That makes the RBD a prime target for the antibodies that our bodies generate to defend against the virus.

>In the new study, researchers used a method called deep mutational scanning to find out which mutations positively or negatively influence the RBD from being able to bind to ACE2 and/or thwart antibodies from striking their target. Here’s how it works: Rather than waiting for new mutations to arise, the researchers created a library of RBD fragments, each of which contained a change in a single nucleotide “letter” that would alter the spike protein’s shape and/or function by swapping one amino acid for another. It turns out that there are more than 3,800 such possible mutations, and Bloom’s team managed to make all but a handful of those versions of the RBD fragment.

>The team then used a standard laboratory approach to measure systematically how each of those single-letter typos altered RBD’s ability to bind ACE2 and infect human cells. They also measured how those changes affected three different therapeutic antibodies from recognizing and binding to the viral RBD...

>Based on the data, the researchers created four mutational maps for SARS-CoV-2 to escape each of the three therapeutic antibodies, as well as for the REGN-COV2 cocktail...Viral genome data from the infected patient showed that these maps can indeed be used to predict likely paths of viral evolution...

>The researchers also looked to data from all known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants as of Jan. 11, 2021, for evidence of escape mutations. They found that a substantial number of mutations with potential to allow escape from antibody treatment already are present, particularly in parts of Europe and South Africa.

>...While it’s possible some COVID-19 vaccines may offer less protection against some of these new variants—and recent results have suggested the AstraZeneca vaccine may not provide much protection against the South African variant, there’s still enough protection in most other current vaccines to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death. And the best way to keep SARS-CoV-2 from finding new ways to escape our ongoing efforts to end this terrible pandemic is to double down on whatever we can do to prevent the virus from multiplying and spreading in the first place.

>For now, emergence of these new variants should encourage all of us to take steps to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. That means following the three W’s: Wear a mask, Watch your distance, Wash your hands often. It also means rolling up our sleeves to get vaccinated as soon as the opportunity arises.",8,0.079,0.036,0.884,0.9474

The [original guidance here](https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/covid_19_vaccine_u_s_distribution_fact_sheet) (and key points pasted below) allowed for 5 days in a standard fridge, after up to 30 days in a cooler/freezer with dry ice resupply (dry ice you can get at most grocery stores) which in my experience is likely to be -40 to -15°C (not the -80°C that dry ice sublimates at), after up to 6 months in -70°C commercial deep freezer.

* Once a POU receives a thermal shipper with our vaccine, they have three options for storage:
   * \- Ultra-low-temperature freezers, which are commercially available and can extend shelf life for **up to six months**.
   * \- The Pfizer thermal shippers, in which doses will arrive, that can be used as temporary storage units by refilling with dry ice every five days for **up to 30 days of storage**.
   * \- Refrigeration units that are commonly available in hospitals. The vaccine can be stored for **five days** at refrigerated **2-8°C conditions**.
* After storage for up to 30 days in the Pfizer thermal shipper, vaccination centers can transfer the vials to 2-8°C storage conditions for an additional five days, for a total of up to 35 days.

Everything else is much less transmissible, much less dangerous / more manageable, broadly covered by herd immunity in most countries, or all three.

Unvaccinated individuals or those with waning immunity are inherently at risk by being in the same room as this virus. 

The only way one could possibly get rid of the morbidity / mortality hazard without herd immunity would be with the hypothesis that whatever AstraZeneca's other failings, it will prevent severe illness even when it does not work on transmission.

Not quite . I am a math/stats/ai guy, not an epidemiologist, but it's obvious from the definitions how to calculate it. R (strictly, R\_0) is the average number of people one infected person infects, assuming no-one is immune (i.e. at the start of an outbreak). If X% of the population is immune, then R\*(1-X) is the average number of people one infected person infects (1-X being the fraction of susceptible people each infected person encounters). So if R\*(1-X) < 1, each infected person infects less than one other person, and therefore the total number infected must decay (it's exponential decay if you think about it).  That's herd immunity.

Rewriting R\*(1-X)  < 1 in terms of X you get X > 1-1/R or X > (R-1)/R. Plugging in R=2.5 gives X > 1.5/2.5 = 3/5 = 60%. Thus, in the crude first-order model, herd immunity for Covid requires X=60% immunity. Hence, a vaccine that is 62% effective (AstraZeneca), applied to the entire population, is barely good enough. 

My point is that with any mitigation R will be considerably less than 2.5, and  asymptomatic transmission (i.e. immunity conferred without vaccination), X will be considerably larger than 62%, so there's actually a wider margin than the article claims.",6,0.077,0.137,0.787,-0.9681

Well that's what more or less in agreement with what was wrote by JCVI. And ""There is currently no strong evidence"" is not as assumption, it's a statement

*This* is an assumption- To borrow their own critique ""this is not supported by published evidence"". 

Will the titres fall? No reason to think they won't;  that's what tends to happen with vaccines or infections for that matter--  we see a peak, we see a waning. That's the immune system doing what it does.  Once we see the waning that doesn't necessarily we're going to see that ""very reduced immunity"" translate to masses of infections.

> The population risk is that the UK's delayed second dose could strongly favour the emergence of consequential SARS-CoV-2 variants resulting from sub-optimal or partial immunity. 

It's not quite fair to suggest waiting 12 weeks (or more like 10 weeks) vs 6 weeks to boost suddenly means that those people all have ""partial immunity""..Not as as strong, during those weeks? quite possibly, especially for older groups.  But it's not like there are special components in the boost that tops protection up from 20% to 100% and then adds some extra layers not found from the first dose. 

As you said nobody is calling for the J&J one dose vaccine to be prohibited based on the idea giving one dose outright would create a permanent state of ""partial immunity"". Partial immunity here is used here a bit dramatically imo. 


> The Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies has also documented concern about emergence of variants as a result of the delayed second dose

And yet, the conclusion of that document was: ""not a big deal, still seems in favor"", not that this article mentioned that conclusion!

> Sub-optimal vaccination will create selective pressure facilitating the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants, 

By this logic we shouldn't vaccinate with anything other than Moderna/ Pfizer. Because J&J or AZ or Sinovac, Sinopharm etc are ""sub-optimal"". By this logic we possibly shouldn't bother vaccinating at all with vaccines that don't generate mucosal immunity.  It's an oversimplification of long term picture to only highlight the negative selection pressure of vaccinating faster and not consider the alternative strategy also creates selective pressure, the mutations that have occured thus far didn't occur in the presents of vaccine.  'direct' vaccine induced mutations isn't exactly a common phenomenon. 

It's not certain what long term impact on protection or durability is of a longer interval, it could be there's actually a net improvement to delaying. With AZ that's the case. Obviously theres less wiggle room for efficacy improvements with pfizer, it looks good even with one dose , let alone 2 after 3 weeks, on historically dominant strains. It remains to be seen whether an improvement could be eeked out but it's certainly not so cut and dry to consider delaying dose interval can only result in 'worse immunity' or increased risk.

There are some valid concerns to extending the dose interval and clearly there is less information on how the vaccine would work with longer dose interval than we had for the gold standard trials,  but the article to me reads a little biased and rigid in how they're making it out to be a pure gamble fraught with risk, with only possible negative outcomes

 If we consider supply as constraining factor In context of risk/reward modelling the delay would seem to have made sense during a period of high spread in December/January , if we expect seasonal reductions in spread bolstered by lockdowns--  even if immunity were to have waned within the next 10 weeks it does you would have covered more vulnerable people with a blanket of protection during the most vulnerable months",9,0.095,0.089,0.816,0.9062

And that's the biggest problem with those who have this rigid view in the face of growing data. Instead of trying to problem-solve through this and help to determine the best risk-reward strategy, their view is that because the vaccine was only tested at a three week interval, everything else has unlimited risk and therefore can't be done.",4,0.097,0.093,0.81,0.3843

go4xjjo,2021-02-20,"""Findings

Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4–74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3–85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59–0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3–91·2] at ≥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0–69·9] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18–55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01–2·68]).

Interpretation 

The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.""",1,0.026,0.028,0.946,-0.2177

gofvt0c,2021-02-22,"You’re close. There’s an important nuance when talking about if a vaccine prevents ‘infection’ vs if a vaccine prevents ‘disease’. 

Infection is when a virus successfully enters your body and can multiply. Disease is when your body starts showing symptoms of an escalating immune attack. 

Usually when talking about the efficacy of the vaccines, people are talking about preventing disease. You *may* still be infected and the virus is replicating enough to become transmissible, but you remain asymptomatic and show no disease (no coughing, no fever, no hospitalizations). On the other hand, if you are not *infected*, you do not have virus build up in your system at all, so you cannot spread said virus.

So ultimately, it’s not clear what the percentages of people are showing no disease vs not getting infected at all. So if most people are not showing disease, they may still be transmissible. But if people are showing not to be infected, we *know* those specific cases cannot transmit.",19,0.13,0.087,0.783,0.7895

I'm confused by your comment, and how you think it is super strange that AZ is not covered.  This is the SIREN study. 

The full title:

""Effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Against Infection and COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage in Healthcare Workers in England, Multicentre Prospective Cohort Study (the SIREN Study)""

> Methods: The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff working in publicly funded hospitals. ... to estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infections

 Pfizer was approved almost a month earlier and doses were given to these study cohorts earlier, (in hospitals with cold storage especially) before AZ in larger numbers; hence why they study Pfizer first. 

It's mentioned in associated press release PDF (linked below) 

> This first report summarises early routine data on the impact and effectiveness of the 
COVID-19 vaccination programme in England. Evidence so far relates to the impact of the Pfizer vaccine as AstraZeneca vaccine has only been in widespread use for a few 
weeks. 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963532/COVID-19_vaccine_effectiveness_surveillance_report_February_2021_FINAL.pdf

 Also highlighted in the full paper of SIREN study; linked below

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399

> With fewer of the cohort vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine, and the later roll-out resulting  in less follow-up time accrued, we are currently unable to investigate the effectiveness of the 
ChAdOx1 vaccine within this study.

Data from AstraZeneca rollout is coming later. This is emphasised even in the press release.

> PHE is also monitoring the real-world impact of the AstraZeneca vaccine and will publish these findings in due course

In short I don't think it's particularly mysterious/strange/shady that data from Pfizer only is presented here",21,0.022,0.038,0.94,-0.4313

goodt9r,2021-02-24,One thing that confuses me is they state a vaccine effectiveness after day 14 of the first dose.

gors52u,2021-02-24,"The simple answer is that this is an unavoidable problem that makes assessing the efficacy of a vaccine shortly after vaccination very hard.  We'd like to know the date of infection (or nearly as good, date of symptom onset) for everyone in the study so we could put things on the right timeline.  But generally we don't have that information.

> The five outcomes of interest were documented SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by positive PCR test, documented symptomatic Covid-19, hospital admission for Covid-19, severe Covid-19 (according to National Institutes of Health criteria)8 and death from Covid-19. Each of these outcomes includes the outcomes that follow it.

That part of the study is looking only at days 14 through 20, not days 14+.  It is saying that during that 7-day period:

* The number of people who tested positive was 40-51% lower in the vaccinated group than the unvaccinated.

* The number of people who had symptoms start was 50-63% lower.

* The number of people who were admitted to a hospital was 56-86% lower.

* The number of people who died on days 14-20 after vaccination was 19-100% lower than in the unvaccinated group.

The study also includes numbers for 7+ days after the second dose, which should not suffer from this problem nearly as much.",3,0.113,0.124,0.763,-0.6994
goq2tu9,2021-02-24,"> This difference may reflect the high level of transmission in Israel during the study period, which affected both the vaccinated persons and the controls equally during the first 12 days after administration of the first dose. To eliminate this distortion, we estimated first-dose effectiveness of the vaccine against Covid-19 for the period from days 14 through 20; the estimated effectiveness was 57%.

That wouldn't encompass what the parent commenter was talking about. Is there another adjustment I missed?

It seems closer to what is discussed here, but which did not lead to an adjustment:

> Finally, the date of onset of symptoms was not available for the analysis. Instead, for infection outcomes, the date was set to the date of swab collection for the first positive PCR test. Given that there was likely to have been a time gap between the onset of symptoms and swab collection, the observed divergence of the cumulative incidence plots for the infection outcomes between the vaccinated persons and unvaccinated controls may be slightly delayed. In parallel, there might be an underestimation of the vaccine effectiveness at each time window, since the estimate actually reflects a narrower window for the vaccine to be active. Because SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing is highly accessible in Israel and can be done without referral in a matter of hours, we estimate this potential time gap and thus the vaccine effectiveness underestimation to be small.",3,0.039,0.02,0.941,0.7776

gopo9w6,2021-02-24,"This article / press release says they are doing three things at once.  


One is testing if one more shot of the current vaccine is enough to protect against the known variants. Basically, one more dose of the currently used vaccine - how much additional protection does it give.  


One is testing a new ""formula"" that's targeted specifically to the new mutation. Will it protect against these new variants safely AND against old?  


And one is a combined version of the currently used vaccine with the booster in one dose.   


  
It also appears that they may be experimenting with smaller doses since Moderna is a larger dose than Pfizer already and if we could get the same effectiveness with less, we could speed the vaccination process a ton.   


Is the booster necessary? For Moderna, yes. This is all opinion, I'm not an expert. 

&#x200B;

 If the new vaccine protects against Brazil/SA at 95%+ AND offers the same protection against all other strains we currently know about, why not update all manufacturing to the new strain?

Two, practice - we've seen strains emerge that were concerning, Moderna is smart to start figuring out how to make boosters against variants today so the process is faster and more optimized as needed. See also how long it took to get the current vaccines done, approved, and mass produced (they are STILL ramping up). A lot was learned in the last year.

Three, they're testing a few other things, like if giving half the vaccine quantity is as effective or not - if we could literally use half the vaccine, we could vaccinate a ton of people much more quickly. 

Four, money and the stock market. The market responds to growth potential more than anything, there's lots of fear of variants, why not combine the two (incentive for profit and marketing 101) and announce ""We're on this - we will be a solution if this is a problem!""

Basically, there's zero reason not to. Remember Moderna has never had an approved product before now and there was doubt whether they ever would. Now they're a huge portion of vaccinations in the US and will be globally - this is THE market for them. It's not like Pfizer or J&J who have billions of dollars in other products - Moderna right now is basically a R&D outfit with a ton of expertise and intellectual property that produced a great vaccine for COVID - and little more.

I agree, but only just. A considerable portion of the gen pop has some level of vaccine skepticism. That skepticism is stronger with minority and rural communities, exactly where it could do the most harm with FB shares about J&J being inferior. 

> How many people could tell you what manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccine they got, or whether it was trivalent or quadrivalent?

This is exactly the problem. They don't know the science. They are just familiar with (social) media's portrayal. 

We can probably agree from the mask ""debate"" that public perception is not tied to science. It is also reasonable to conclude that scientifically accurate messaging explaining nuance and the importance of broad compliance has not been effective. 

A lot of posters are quoting the article author's explanations about why it is a good idea to get the J&J and why it is misleading to compare trial results. I agree with all that. What seems to be absent is an acknowledgement that a large (perhaps 1/3?) portion of the population is not only skeptical but their skepticism is hardened into cynicism when confronted with scientific rationale demonstrating that their position is objectively incorrect or the information that prompted their position, such as headlines about J&J being less effective, is misleading or simply lacks enough nuance to make an informed conclusion. 

Effective health policy can't leave those people behind. We can't simply tell a large portion of the population (whether it's 1/4 or 1/3) that they should get the J&J vaccine when their number's called and if they think it's not as good they've been misinformed and expect them to react like an academic. We must acknowledge that human nature is that once a subject becomes emotional for someone they cease to respond to other types of messaging.

Do you know where this was published?  Novavax was at 60% for non-HIV and 50% for HIV (efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection of B.1.351), but I haven't seen the actual numbers for J&J.

> And the Novavax vaccine appears to be about 96% effective against the original major variant, which is actually a bit higher than the mRNA vaccine

Novavax was the best in phase 1 and phase 3.  The credible intervals for efficacy against symptomic COVID classic are not wide, and their central estimates (Novavax 96%, mRNA 95%, J&J 72%) remain very usable.

Most vaccines have no trial-quality data for B.1.351, and the ones that do (Novavax mentioned above, J&J if they have published South Africa data by lineage, and the AZ mini-trial) have extremely wide credible intervals.  I will certainly agree the jury is still out on how vaccines handle 484K, but from preliminary numbers I can only assume we're going to want booster shots once we have enough production capacity.

We don't have data from all vaccines, but it now looks like B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Rio) are no worry for vaccines.  With P.1 (Manaus) we still have zero data on beyond a single study examining monoclonal antibody effectiveness that makes it look just like B.1.351.",6,0.118,0.015,0.867,0.9828

gooj4ft,2021-02-25," **Summary** 

The race to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK–B.1.1.7, South Africa–B.1.351 and Brazil–P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein which facilitates viral cell entry via the Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant.",2,0.082,0.012,0.906,0.836

>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., February 26, 2021 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) unanimously voted to recommend Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Company’s single-shot COVID-19 vaccine candidate for adults 18 and older, developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The vote was based on a totality of scientific evidence provided by the Company, including efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial.

>“We are extremely grateful to the VRBPAC members for their extensive review of the data supporting emergency use of Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We believe our COVID-19 vaccine candidate has the potential to help change the trajectory of the pandemic and stand ready to make it available to protect the public as soon as possible.”

>The next step in the process is for the FDA to decide whether to grant an EUA for Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The recommendation of the FDA Advisory Committee is non-binding, and the final decision on authorization is made by the FDA. Under an EUA, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions during a declared public health emergency. If authorized by the FDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will then provide a recommendation on the use and roll-out of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

>“We are grateful to everyone who has contributed to the wealth of data we presented today, including study participants, site investigators and teams, collaborators and everyone who has worked so hard to bring us to this moment. We are confident our COVID-19 vaccine candidate will have a significant impact in protecting people around the world,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson.

>Johnson & Johnson is committed to making its COVID-19 vaccine candidate available on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The Company is prepared to supply its vaccine immediately upon EUA and expects to deliver enough single-dose vaccine candidate by the end of March to enable the full vaccination of more than 20 million people in the U.S. The Company plans to deliver 100 million single-dose vaccines to the U.S. during the first half of 2021.

>Johnson & Johnson also recently announced its submission of a European Conditional Marketing Authorisation Application to the European Medicines Agency as well as an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) with the World Health Organization for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In addition, rolling submissions for the single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate have been initiated in several countries worldwide.",46,0.098,0.045,0.858,0.9754

gp24kp2,2021-02-26,"IIRC, antibody levels don't peak until about 50 days after vaccination with this one. Their endpoint for releasing data was after 4 weeks, which means it's likely the initial numbers we saw are lower than what this vaccine will actually give. Even in the phase 3 interim data, they said that after 49 days there were no cases of severe disease, hospitalizations, or deaths. This lines up perfectly with when antibody levels would peak. This is info I feel a lot of people are overlooking. We can't say for sure until we have more stringent data, but the FDA did say that in the few weeks since the initial data release, they saw an increase in efficacy against the Brazilian and South African variants.

We saw in that trial, that after 3 weeks, it was 85% effective against severe disease, but after 49 days, it increased to 100%. The AZ vaccine saw a simila pattern (big boost in efficacy when spacing out the second dose, as opposed to administering only 4 weeks after the initial one).

It seems like J&J set their endpoint too early. Perhaps 7 or 8 weeks would've been a better one. We've also seen an increase in efficacy against the variants in the few weeks since the initial data release, which would also indicate a higher efficacy if more time had been given between inoculation and checking efficacy.

Fortunately, for the 2 dose trial, they spaced them out about 2 months or so. Hopefully that will yield a decent boost to the overall efficacy.",10,0.135,0.016,0.849,0.9731
gp8v6a2,2021-02-26,"> This means that this vaccines is actually much less effective than people think it is and it's probably even less effective against asymptomatic transmission.

I have to disagree. It would mean that the J&J vaccine is probably a little bit more effective that we estimate (comparatively speaking), since the other vaccines' inclusion of milder infections may have increased their overall effectiveness. Of course we don't know that for sure, and the mRNA vaccines are most likely still ""better"" overall, especially considering the rates of severe diseases seen with the J&J vaccines in comparison to the mRNA vaccines.

* The first primary endpoint was the efficacy of BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in participants who had been without serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after the second dose. 
* Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility

**[Moderna:](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389)**

* The primary end point was the efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in preventing a first occurrence of symptomatic Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in the per-protocol population, among participants who were seronegative at baseline.
* Covid-19 cases were defined as occurring in participants who had at least two of the following symptoms: fever (temperature ≥38°C), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, or new olfactory or taste disorder, or as occurring in those who had at least one respiratory sign or symptom (including cough, shortness of breath, or clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia) and at least one nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if the participant was hospitalized) that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test.

All of these vaccines introduce a foreign genetic material coding for viral proteins into the recipient’s cells and then the recipient makes a strong immune response against those foreign proteins.

Progression to more severe stage covid would be reliant on more factors than vaccination alone, and establishing infection in the first place is needed for progression. 

I just checked the FDA briefing packet, and it doesn't seem like there was any difference when you included mild cases too, but there weren't really many mild cases to add (which is kind of odd?).

gou6yve,2021-02-26,"#Abstract

**Background**

The threshold of protection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies and their longevity are not known. Interpretation of serological results in with respect to international reference material can inform this essential question.

**Methods**

1,507 West Midlands dental care professionals were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was determined and the cohort was followed longitudinally for 6 months until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and commencement of vaccination. 

**Results**

Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3% in this cohort, compared to estimates in the general population of between 6-7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3 and 6-month follow up and conferred a 74% reduced risk of infection. During follow-up, no PCR-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. Post-vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in individuals with who were seropositive at baseline. 

**Conclusion**

Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 months after initial sampling and 9 months from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.

gotbsk4,2021-02-26,">The UK has initiated mass COVID-19 immunisation, with healthcare workers (HCWs) given early priority because of the potential for workplace exposure and risk of onward transmission to patients. The UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended maximising the number of people vaccinated with first doses at the expense of early booster vaccinations, based on single dose efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 disease.^1-3

>At the time of writing, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorisation in the UK, including the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). A vital outstanding question is whether this vaccine prevents or promotes asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than symptomatic COVID-19 disease, because sub-clinical infection following vaccination could continue to drive transmission. This is especially important because many UK HCWs have received this vaccine, and nosocomial COVID-19 infection has been a persistent problem.

>Through the implementation of a 24 h-turnaround PCR-based comprehensive HCW screening programme at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUHNFT), we previously demonstrated the frequent presence of pauci- and asymptomatic infection amongst HCWs during the UK’s first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.^4 Here, we evaluate the effect of first-dose BNT162b2 vaccination on test positivity rates and cycle threshold (Ct) values in the asymptomatic arm of our programme, which now offers weekly screening to all staff.

>Vaccination of HCWs at CUHNFT began on 8th December 2020, with mass vaccination from 8th January 2021. Here, we analyse data from the two weeks spanning 18th to 31st January 2021, during which: (a) the prevalence of COVID-19 amongst HCWs remained approximately constant; and (b) we screened comparable numbers of vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs. Over this period, 4,408 (week 1) and 4,411 (week 2) PCR tests were performed from individuals reporting well to work. We stratified HCWs <12 days or > 12 days post-vaccination because this was the point at which protection against symptomatic infection began to appear in phase III clinical trial.^2

>26/3,252 (0·80%) tests from unvaccinated HCWs were positive (Ct<36), compared to 13/3,535 (0·37%) from HCWs <12 days post-vaccination and 4/1,989 (0·20%) tests from HCWs ≥12 days post-vaccination (p=0·023 and p=0·004, respectively; Fisher’s exact test, Figure). This suggests a four-fold decrease in the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs ≥12 days post-vaccination, compared to unvaccinated HCWs, with an intermediate effect amongst HCWs <12 days post-vaccination.

>A marked reduction in infections was also seen when analyses were repeated with: (a) inclusion of HCWs testing positive through both the symptomatic and asymptomatic arms of the programme (56/3,282 (1·71%) unvaccinated vs 8/1,997 (0·40%) ≥12 days post-vaccination, 4·3-fold reduction, p=0·00001); (b) inclusion of PCR tests which were positive at the limit of detection (Ct>36, 42/3,268 (1·29%) vs 15/2,000 (0·75%), 1·7-fold reduction, p=0·075); and (c) extension of the period of analysis to include six weeks from December 28th to February 7th 2021 (113/14,083 (0·80%) vs 5/4,872 (0·10%), 7·8-fold reduction, p=1x10-9). In addition, the median Ct value of positive tests showed a non-significant trend towards increase between unvaccinated HCWs and HCWs > 12 days post-vaccination (23·3 to 30·3, Figure), suggesting that samples from vaccinated individuals had lower viral loads.

>We therefore provide real-world evidence for a high level of protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, at a time of predominant transmission of the UK COVID-19 variant of concern 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), and amongst a population with a relatively low frequency of prior infection (7.2% antibody positive).^5",33,0.087,0.023,0.89,0.9874

Moderna and Pfizer are going to exceed their 200 million total doses by March 31st. That is 100 million people or more.

J&J has promised 20 million doses, so that is 20 million people.

Total is 120+ million by March 31st. There are only 250 million adults nominally. In the 4 weeks of April Pfizer will deliver another 52 million doses, Moderna will deliver 40 million (fiscal disclosures where these companies have to tell the truth as best as they know it). Assuming uniform rate for J&J to 100 million in June that would be 26 million in April.

That means without any new approvals 46 million mRNA and 26 million J&J in April. This is 72 million.

So total at the end of April is 192 million+... That is 77% of the US adult population. If we get there without hesitancy limiting things I'll be shocked.

Beyond this Novavax and Oxford are both going to finish their trials in the next 5 weeks, and based on international trials both would likely get EUAs.

Although the initial enthusiasm for the effort has so far allowed us to meet the administrative requirements that the available dosing requires, that enthusiasm is waning, and I would anticipate that we will not muster the required personnel to double capacity.

All this is to say, directly in relation to your comment, that sticking with the two dose schedule at half load will further exacerbate the need for administration by certified personnel (which I'm anecdotally deeming unlikely), whereas the delayed second dose would relatively increase the number of people vaccinated without increasing adminstrative load.

gpe87dz,2021-02-27,"Given that it is still winter, there is every reason to think it will spread more in the next 30 days than the 30 after that even if nobody were to be vaccinated.

So assume 100 million shots will be given in the next 60 days. Giving those same shots, appointment, etc. uses virtually the same amount of resources whether they are the same each time or two different people. The argument regarding lack of capacity isn't convincing.

We're still over 1000 deaths a day here. Even using the weakest data on 1 shot mRNA, estimating 75% efficacy after 12 days and assuming it doesn't improve after that, I don't see how giving half as many a vaccine with 95% efficacy after 45 or so days would be more impactful. The Israel data suggests the difference isn't actually anywhere near 20%, and is in the single digits. Nevertheless the paper makes it pretty clear staying the course is not the most impactful strategy.

Where I live our state is doing a bit better than the national average. Because of the 2 shot strategy, they don't expect to even begin mass vaccinations of those in 1c (65+, less essential essential workers, pre-existing conditions) until April. Even if they were to do all of them (1/3 of our state) they'd still have another 1/3 left to do.

I'm not too concerned about potential slightly reduced compliance with the 2nd shot. That's what massive health education campaigns are for. Even so, they may still be as protected as a 1 shot J&J. These two vaccines would absolutely been approved if they had only showed 75% efficacy 2 weeks after 1 shot. The new Pfizer analysis helps shoot down the argument that the new data on health workers and from Israel isn't clinical trial data, so we just don't know.

While I'd like to show models validating which strategy would be most impactful over the next 3 months, I think it's critical we begin delayed 2nd shots immediately.

It's looking like we're all going to need regular vaccines with updated cocktails for various emerging strains, which would also address the fear that not doing the 2nd shot as in the trials will lead to less durable responses. The most widely circulating variants 3 months from now could be completely different from what was happening during the trials and potentially result in the 2nd shot not being as important as a retooled 2nd shot, which should be somewhat seen as a different vaccination.",2,0.06,0.068,0.872,-0.2056

88% of the deaths are in 60+, that entire group will be vaccinated (who want it) in the next 3 weeks. Everyone who already got a 1st dose is already entitled to a second dose because they agreed to get vaccinated on a two dose promise not a one dose one. So a change in policy today, would mean having extra vaccine doses maybe next week. You save 1 week maybe on the 65+ group, maybe, and that is things go smoothly.

It also hasn't been studied well in the mRNA for durability. Its a horrible idea. Idiotic in fact. We all wish there was a magic way to immunize 250 million people in a day but there isn't.

If you want to save the most lives perhaps start exporting it then since the most vulnerable in the US is now covered and make everyone under 65 wait until 2022...

**Objectives** To estimate the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against confirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths. To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern.

**Design** Test negative case control design 

**Setting** Community COVID-19 PCR testing in England

**Participants** All adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million). All COVID-19 testing in the community among eligible individuals who reported symptoms between 8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021 was included in the analysis.

**Interventions** One and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine.

**Main outcome measures** Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. 

**Results** Individuals aged >=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen. Individuals aged >=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.

**Conclusion** Vaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.",20,0.042,0.055,0.903,-0.3919

gpgez6k,2021-03-02,"ABSTRACT 

The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike pro- teins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multi- ple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human an- giotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combina- tion thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.

IMPORTANCE 

A vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.",1,0.065,0.019,0.916,0.8776

gpv5rt7,2021-03-03,"It would make sense to adopt the ""take any vaccine you can, as early as possible"" + ""extend dosage to vaccinate more people ASAP"" approach in places with high covid case rates. However, Canada has low rates of covid. Furthermore, summer is approaching: we know from last summer that warmer weather and its associated factors (e.g. people spending less time indoors, better ventilation from open windows, UV light killing virus on surfaces, no school, etc...) significantly reduce cases. Canada's cases were very low last summer.

We know that AstraZeneca has only 27% efficacy in terms of stopping asymptomatic infection. Moderna seems to have 60% efficacy of stopping infection/transmission based on a clinical trial study that tested every person coming in for their 2nd vaccine dose. Pfizer and Moderna are very similar.

We know that practically speaking, it will take roughly 6-12 months (possibly more) before fully vaccinate people get vaccinated again (due to immunity from vaccine wearing off).

While I understand and agree that high risk people, such as over 60s, those with obesity, diabetes, or another comorbid disorder which puts them at increased risk, or those who get exposed more through work or living in a household with someone who is more exposed should take any vaccine ASAP, I fail to see how rushing to give all healthy 20 year olds the AstraZeneca vaccine makes sense. Doing this actually reduces/harms the chances of achieving herd immunity, given AstraZeneca's poor record of stopping infection/transmission (as opposed to stopping symptoms/illness). Now Canada is also getting millions doses of Johnson and Johnson, which is also untested in terms of whether it prevents infection/transmission.

gpj9q20,2021-03-03,"#Abstract

**Background**

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use.

**Methods**

In this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 micrograms recombinant spike protein with 50 micrograms Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy greater than or equal to 7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.

**Results**

A total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

**Conclusions**

The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.

It's actually impossible to control for confounding factors like that in any retrospective study.  They try to minimize them by making the group as homogeneous as possible (e.g., looking only at health care workers).

The whole virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated an interim vaccine efficacy of 81% in its Phase 3 clinical trial. The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest ever conducted in India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research.

>“Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today’s results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.

>COVAXIN® demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID 19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” said Dr. Krishna Ella, Chairman & Managing Director, Bharat Biotech.

...

>The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.

>**The first interim analysis is based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 7 cases observed in the BBV152 (COVAXIN®) group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6%.**

>The interim analysis included a preliminary review of the safety database, which showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The trial's conduct and monitoring are as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines and have been outsourced to IQVIA.

**Background**

At the end of 2020, Denmark launched an immunization program against SARS-CoV-2. The Danish health authorities prioritized persons currently living in long-term care facilities (LTCF residents) and frontline healthcare workers (HCW) as the first receivers of vaccination. Here we present preliminary population based vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates in these two target groups.

**Methods**

The study was designed as a retrospective registry- and population-based observational cohort study including all LTCF residents and all HWC. The outcome was a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and VE was estimated for different periods following first and second dose. We used Poisson and Cox regressions to estimate respectively crude and calendar time-adjusted VE for the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

**Results**

A total of 39,040 LTCF residents (median age at first dose; 84 years, Interquartile range (IQR): 77-90) and 331,039 HCW (median age at first dose; 47 years, IQR: 36-57) were included. Among LTCF residents, 95.2% and 86.0% received first and second dose from 27 December 2020 until 18 February 2021, for HWC the proportion was 27.8% and 24.4%. During a median follow-up of 53 days , there were 488 and 5,663 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the unvaccinated groups, whereas there were 57 and 52 in LTCF residents and HCW within the first 7 days after the second dose and 27 and 10 cases beyond seven days of second dose. No protective effect was observed for LTCF residents after first dose. In HCW, VE was 17% (95% CI; 4-28) in the > 14 days after first dose (before second dose). Furthermore, the VE in LTCF residents at day 0-7 of second dose was 52% (95% CI; 27-69) and 46% (95% CI; 28-59) in HCW. Beyond seven days of second dose, VE increased to 64% (95% CI; 14-84) and 90% (95% CI; 82-95) in the two groups, respectively.

**Conclusion**

The results were promising regarding the VE both within and beyond seven days of second vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine currently used in many countries to help mitigate the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Impact of the research: So far, observational studies of the real-word effectiveness of the mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been limited to the period after the administration of the first dose. This is the first report to date to present vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates after the second BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine. We estimated a VE of 52% and 46% in LTCF residents and HCW within seven days, which increased to 64% and 90% in the two groups respectively beyond seven days of immunization.

While that increasingly seems to be the case in terms of the vaccine's efficacy in terms of stopping symptoms/illness/death, the effect of this has not been measured on how it affects efficacy in terms of stopping infection and transmission.

Real world data, however, is available from Israel.

I can't offer the link for the stats because it will be auto-removed as it is a newspaper article and I don't have the article to the source from the Israeli Health Ministry (which the article claims to get the data from), but the numbers seem more or less correct based on any of the vaccine tracking websites:

42% of Israel's population has received 2 doses (I believe all Pfizer, or at least almost all). 54% have received 1 dose.

According to this reputable vaccine tracking site, 2 weeks ago the above numbers were not that much lower:

[https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

Yet look at Israel's daily case count; in the past 2 weeks cases have stayed the same:

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/)

I don't know if it is still too early, we probably need another 2 weeks or so until more time has passed for the 1st dose to ""kick into effect"" for those who just recently got it. But then the data will be contaminated because more people will have received the 2nd dose, and I believe Israel is giving the 2nd dose on time (as per Pfizer's recommendation of I believe around 3 weeks after the 1st dose). With that in mind I think now is a reasonably accurate time to assess whether the 1st dose is enough to prevent infection/transmission based on Israel's data. So to me it seems concerning: as far as I know Israel has only opened up high risk public places to ""green passport"" holders, which means only those who have vaccines can enter. Yet cases are not dropping over the past 2 weeks. This is not promising in terms of the efficacy of 1 dose in preventing infection/transmission. It will take a few more weeks to see whether the 2nd dose will limit infection/transmission. But again: since Israel is giving it on time, it is no guarantee that countries who are extending the time between the dosages will experience the same potential success in terms of prevention of infection/transmission.

Yet increasingly more and more countries are extending the length of time between dosages, some up to 4 months. I guess the decision to give more people 1 dose now and wait long till the 2nd dose vs. give less people the vaccine now and give them 2 doses at the manufacturer-recommended time interval between doses depends on how many cases/hospitalization/deaths there are in any given region. If cases are really high then it would seem logical to give more people the vaccine now, but if cases are low, to me it would make more sense to not risk lowering the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of preventing infection/transmission and give it at the manufacturer approved time interval between doses.",8,0.045,0.028,0.927,0.9075

gqcw1rd,2021-03-09,"#Summary

**Background**

BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 μg or 6 μg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 μg and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28.

**Methods**

We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12–65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 μg with Algel-IMDG or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519.

**Findings**

Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (197·0 [95% CI 155·6–249·4]) than the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (100·9 [74·1–137·4]; p=0·0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (92·9% [95% CI 88·2–96·2] of 184 participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98·3% [95·1–99·6]) of 177 participants in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 92·5 (95% CI 77·7–110·2) in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 160·1 (135·8–188·8) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (88·0% [95% CI 82·4–92·3]) of 184 participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96·6% [92·8–98·8]) of 177 participants in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 μg with Algel-IMDG and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20·0%; 95% CI 14·7–26·5] of 190) and the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21·1%; 15·5–27·5] of 190) was observed on days 0–7 and days 28–35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 39·9 (95% CI 32·0–49·9) in the 3μg with Algel-IMDG group, 69·5 (53·7–89·9) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 53·3 (40·1–71·0) in the 6 μg with Algel group, and 20·7 (14·5–29·5) in the Algel alone group.

**Interpretation**

In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.",7,0.04,0.018,0.943,0.9417

gqchyt9,2021-03-09,"**Abstract**

In the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to SARS-CoV-2. Two critical issues arise: how will the timing of delivery of the second dose affect both infection dynamics and prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.",1,0.16,0.034,0.807,0.9455

If they're doing a trial for B.1.351, why not P.1, and a few others?

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different? If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them? Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster? Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?",17,0.13,0.0,0.87,0.9743

I'm hypothesising here, but it seems like B.1.351 is so well adapted to immune evasion from ancestral strains that its antisera is particularly good at neutralising all the various mutations most likely to cause it in other variants.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant1 now reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the RBM (5 out of 31), but not in RBD neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emergent Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. E484K emergence on a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the vaccine BNT162b.",2,0.019,0.065,0.916,-0.8529

gqlwgwf,2021-03-11,"Abstract  
Background  
Several vaccines are now clinically available under emergency use authorization in the United States and have demonstrated efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19. The impact of vaccines on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely unknown.  
Methods  
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was relative risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among those asymptomatic persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine, as compared to persons who had not received vaccine during the same time period. Relative risk was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, patient residence relative to the hospital (local vs. non-local), healthcare system regions, and repeated screenings among patients using mixed effects log-binomial regression.  
Results  
Positive molecular tests in asymptomatic individuals were reported in 42 (1.4%) of 3,006 tests performed on vaccinated patients and 1,436 (3.2%) of 45,327 tests performed on unvaccinated patients (RR=0.44 95% CI: 0.33-0.60; p<.0001). Compared to unvaccinated patients, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among those >10 days after 1 st dose (RR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.37; p<.0001) and >0 days after 2 nd dose (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.44; p<.0001) in the adjusted analysis.  
Conclusions  
COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine showed a significant association with a reduced risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured during pre-procedural molecular screening. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the vaccines on reduction in asymptomatic infections supplementing the randomized trial results on symptomatic patients.",2,0.059,0.044,0.898,0.7506

>JERUSALEM & NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Israel Ministry of Health (MoH), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced real-world evidence demonstrating dramatically lower incidence rates of COVID-19 disease in individuals fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2), underscoring the observed substantial public health impact of Israel’s nationwide immunization program. These new data build upon and confirm previously released data from the MoH demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe and critical hospitalizations, and deaths. The latest analysis from the MoH proves that two weeks after the second vaccine dose protection is even stronger – **vaccine effectiveness was at least 97% in preventing symptomatic disease, severe/critical disease and death.** This comprehensive real-world evidence can be of importance to countries around the world as they advance their own vaccination campaigns one year after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

>Findings from the analysis were derived from de-identified aggregate Israel MoH surveillance data collected between January 17 and March 6, 2021, when the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was the only vaccine available in the country and when the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 (formerly referred to as the U.K. variant) was the dominant strain. **Vaccine effectiveness was at least 97% against symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe and critical hospitalizations, and deaths.** Furthermore, the analysis found a **vaccine effectiveness of 94% against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections**.

Furthermore, the analysis found a vaccine effectiveness of  94% against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.  For all outcomes, vaccine effectiveness was measured from two weeks after the second dose.

There is one problem here.

Unfortunately, no information is provided in terms of how the ""94% effectiveness"" against asymptomatic cases was established.

There was an earlier study, I can't link it because I can't find the original study and news is not allowed, but in Israel they looked at the existing national testing data and looked at the efficacy against infection in terms of fully vaccinated people versus non-vaccinated people. They found that it was 89.4%: non-vaccinated were 89.4% more likely to test positive compared to unvaccinated people. However, this was problematic because since it was based on existing national testing data: obviously vaccinated people would be much less likely to undergo testing (because they are much less likely to have symptoms even if they get infected). So obviously those who were unvaccinated were much more likely to develop symptoms and hence undergo testing. So the true efficacy based on that study (if the testing rates were equal among the 2 groups) would have been UNDER the 89.4%.

So I am not sure how this new study found 94% efficacy. How can it be higher than 89.4%? We need to know if the testing rate was the same. They said they looked at Israel MoH surveillance data collected beteween Jan 17 and March 6... this implies they did not do testing for the purpose of this study. This means we have no idea what the testing rate was. I mean... they are saying those unvaccinated were 94% more likely to develop asymptomatic covid as compared to fully vaccinated people 2 weeks after their dose. But it doesn't say how many got tested and how many were in each group for the purpose of this study. Why would people who get fully vaccinated and don't develop any symptoms go on their own to get tested? I would imagine the number of unvaccinated people without symptoms getting tested would be much higher than their vaccinated counterparts. 

Another problem: they said it is based on vaccinated people who got tested 2 weeks after getting the 2nd dose. People who get the vaccine know it will take around 2 weeks for it to kick in completely no? So wouldn't they be more likely to stay inside and be cautious until that period of time? This is actually my guess as to how this study found 94% which is higher than 89.4%: I don't think the 89.4% study specifically looked at those in the vaccine group exactly 2 weeks after the test... there was a mix... for some people it could have been many weeks after the 2nd dose, which means by then they would have been less cautious and thus more likely to get infected.. hence the lower 89.4% number.

We need another study in a few weeks: random test x number of fully vaccinated people (with the requirement that it must have been 3+ weeks after they received  their 2nd dose) , and randomly test x number of unvaccinated people, and find out the efficacy in terms of infection. However, even then, that would still probably overestimate the true efficacy rate, because right now in Israel only vaccinated people are allowed to go to certain public places. This means that vaccinated people will interact less with unvaccinated people and therefore this will be a difference in terms of the experiment group and the control group.

gqqubob,2021-03-12,"Vaccination of Scotland’s healthcare workers offers some protection against transmission of Covid-19 to their household contacts.

A study of all healthcare workers employed by the NHS in Scotland and their households (which has not yet been peer-reviewed), shows that the rate of infection with Covid-19 for people that live with healthcare workers is at least 30% lower when the worker has been vaccinated mostly with a single dose. Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.

Research led by Public Health Scotland and the University of Glasgow (with contributions from researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Glasgow Caledonian University, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Strathclyde) involved over 300,000 people in total and ran between 8 December 2020 and 3 March 2021. The study, using record linkage, compared cases of Covid-19 and hospitalisations due to Covid-19 in household members of both vaccinated, and unvaccinated health care workers.

Where healthcare workers had received a second dose of the vaccine at least 14 days before, their household members had a rate of Covid-19 which was at least 54% lower than household members where healthcare workers had not been vaccinated.

While the study was not designed to examine the uptake of vaccination among healthcare workers, current work does suggest that at least some patient facing healthcare workers, particularly younger staff and those not in high exposure roles, may not have been vaccinated yet. We hope that these findings would give them extra encouragement to be vaccinated, as it suggests that the vaccine offers protection not only to themselves but also to their close contacts.

54%.. but it was a mix of AstraZeneca and Pfizer... doesn't specify what the breakdown was... though this study seems to have better methodology compared to this recent study from Pfizer:

Unfortunately the 94% for asymptomatic they claim... they don't give any info on how they calculated it. It looks like they used secondary data analysis... it reads as if they did not create a vaccine and non-vaccine group for the purpose of this study in order to then test each group... so we don't know what the testing rate was between these 2 groups in the existing national data... so how did they come up with the 94% figure? Wouldn't people who get vaccinated and show no symptoms have no reason to get tested? Also, they looked at data 2 weeks after people got their 2nd dose: wouldn't people who got their 2nd dose know that it will take around 2 weeks to fully kick in... and wouldn't this knowledge make them more likely to be cautious and not expose themselves until the 2 weeks has passed... as compared to the non-vaccinated group who did not change their behavior because they didn't get a vaccine? Wouldn't this significantly inflate the efficacy between these 2 groups?

Another problem is that there is another difference between the vaccine and non-vaccine group: even if they properly took 1000 people who had been fully vaccinated and 1000 people who hadn't, and gave them a test and compared efficacy, if there was a high efficacy, there would be a unlikely but possible problem that those who are vaccinated might not catch the virus from other vaccinated people... BUT unvaccinated people may still be able to catch the virus from vaccinated people... . I know this is unlikely, but technically the study would not be able to control for that, because so many people in Israel already fully vaccinated. The only way to control for this is to do the proper test: in a country that still has low vaccine rates, give 1000 people the Pfizer shot, then wait 3+ weeks after the 2nd dose, and test all of them again. Then test 1000 nonvaccinated people and roughly match them for age and body weight. That would show the true efficacy. This is not really hard to do. But to do this, you need to give the 2nd dose on time.. if you space it out too far in order to give more people vaccines, that means it will be the same situation as Israel.. by the time 3+ weeks pass by after the 2nd dose... something like a quarter to half of the country will have already gotten the vaccine just like in Israel.",3,0.033,0.052,0.915,-0.8672

Also, I think we’re starting it beat a dead horse with these titer/neutralization studies. First of all they’re highly inconsistent. You can find one study showing that P.1 is barely more resistant to vaccine induced antibodies than B.117, but then find this study that shows it’s ability to escape to be greater than most studies found B.135 to be able to escape. Generally speaking we can’t really compare studies cause of assay differences, pseudovirus used, time that sera was collected after vaccination, etc. The most accurate thing we can do is utilize live virus, and most papers doing that do show that the ability to neutralize B.135 is mostly preserved, although reduced.

The only thing we can really do is trial at this point, and two companies (Novavax and J&J) have already done that, and that showed a substantial drop in efficacy although efficacy was still modest.

'Notification of blood clots and brain haemorrhages after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine

Yesterday, the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) informed about an unexpected death from a brain haemorrhage in Tynset after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.

Today (March 13), we received three more reports of severe cases of blood clots or brain haemorrhages in younger people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. These are now receiving hospital treatment.

Common to these patients is that they have had a reduced number of blood platelets. Blood clots and subsequent brain haemorrhages are a rare condition.

gr1v7p8,2021-03-14,"Well said. Would like to add some details. The professor of hematology who is involved in treating the Norwegian patients spoke at a press conference today. He emphasized that the patients had isolated thrombocytopenia with normal coagulation panels. This is not what is typically seen in DIC, where the coagulation cascade is heavily involved. 

Although insufficient information has been released to conclude, isolated thrombocytopenia in the context of thrombosis appears more compatible with TTP. The incidence of TTP is thought to be approx 2-4 cases per million per year. As such, 3 cases in a week at a hospital that serves a population of 500 000 is at least unexpected. 

It is important to emphasize that no conclusions can be drawn regarding connection to the vaccine at this time. At the same time we should keep in mind that these events are not your run of the mill deep vein thrombosis - which is not all that uncommon and is associated with e.g. birth control pills.

Maybe AstraZeneca’s wild-type spike protein is more likely to bind to platelet ACE2 receptors (and/or [complement proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158248/)) and set off clotting like actual SARS-CoV-2 can, and the stabilized version used in the other vaccines reduces its ability to do so?",9,0.097,0.0,0.903,0.8225

The spike protein is present in the vaccine but it's also present in COVID-19, so if it is the spike protein that's causing these blood clots, then the people who got them would get blood clots whether they got the vaccine or caught the virus, right? 

The facts, then, are:

- The chance of a blood clot from the vaccine is about 0.0003%

- Your chance of dying of SARS COV-2 is around 3% (higher if you're older and lower if you're younger).

- Taking the vaccine is about 1000x safer than catching COVID

- It's likely that if the vaccine is causing blood clots, it's because of the spike protein. Which means that if you're one of the very unlucky people who gets blood clots as a result of the vaccine, you'll probably get blood clots as a result of the virus too.

Of course I have a basis for it.

We have vaccinated 17 million times and have seen 5 cases, suddenly in a short time frame. Either it's a coincidence or something has changed. There's no other explanation than a batch issue, a frankly negligible frequency or a coincidence.

I'm arguing that it's going to kill more people than the suspension will save because more people will get covid instead.

Following this logic we need to stop flu vaccination right this second because it might cause GBS.

gr4n7wz,2021-03-16,"**Abstract**


**Background**: Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since fall 2020 which have multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. 

**Objective**: We aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA- based vaccine against COVID-19. 

**Methods**: We produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination. 

**Results**: These binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity. 

**Conclusion**: Our binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.",3,0.073,0.022,0.905,0.9044

Medicago received approval from Canadian and US regulatory authorities to proceed with enrolment of healthy adults in the Phase 3 portion of the trial based on positive interim Phase 2 results.

>“We are pleased to take the significant step of initiating the Phase 3 clinical trial at sites around the world,” said Takashi Nagao, CEO and President of Medicago. “This brings us one step closer to delivering an important new COVID-19 vaccine and contributing to the global fight against the pandemic along with our partner GSK.”

>Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer, GSK Vaccines said, “This advance to late stage clinical testing further reinforces our confidence in the adjuvanted vaccine candidate’s potential to make a difference in the continued fight against COVID-19. We look forward to sharing results later this year.”

>Medicago’s plant-derived vaccine candidate against COVID-19 uses Coronavirus-Like-Particle (CoVLP) technology with the vaccine composed of recombinant spike (S) glycoprotein expressed as virus-like-particles (VLPs) co-administered with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant. Two doses of 3.75μg of CoVLP are administered 21 days apart.

>The vaccine candidate, in combination with the pandemic adjuvant, was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 17 February 2021. Fast Track designation allows the FDA to expedite the development and review of new medicines and vaccines intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and address an unmet medical need.

>“The FDA’s decision to grant Fast Track designation for Medicago’s vaccine candidate will help us expedite our efforts to bring the first plant-derived COVID-19 vaccine to market, subject to regulatory approval,” said Carolyn Finkle, Chief Operating Officer of Medicago. “We are grateful to the FDA and look forward to continuing to work with them as we move forward in our clinical trials, planned application for Emergency Use Authorisation and eventual vaccine licensure application process.”

>The Phase 3 portion of the study is an event-driven, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over design that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the adjuvanted CoVLP formulation, compared to placebo. The study will enrol up to 30,000 subjects initially composed of healthy adults (18y to 65y) followed by elderly adults (65y+) and adults with comorbidities. The trial will take place in 10 countries pending regulatory approvals, starting with Canada and the United States, and will enrol males and females from ethnically and racially diverse populations.

gr47z02,2021-03-16,">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 16, 2021-- Moderna Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that the first participants have been dosed in the Phase 2/3 study, called the KidCOVE study, of mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, in children ages 6 months to less than 12 years. The study is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

>“We are pleased to begin this Phase 2/3 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy children in the U.S. and Canada and we thank NIAID and BARDA for their collaboration,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “It is humbling to know that 17.8 million adults in the U.S. have received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to date. We are encouraged by the primary analysis of the Phase 3 COVE study of mRNA-1273 in adults ages 18 and above and this pediatric study will help us assess the potential safety and immunogenicity of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate in this important younger age population.”

>This Phase 2/3 two-part, open label, dose-escalation, age de-escalation (Part 1) and randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study (Part 2) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity and effectiveness of two doses of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. The Company intends to enroll approximately 6,750 pediatric participants in the U.S. and Canada ages 6 months to less than 12 years.

>In Part 1, each participant ages two years to less than 12 years may receive one of two dose levels (50 μg or 100 μg). Also in Part 1, each participant ages six months to less than 2 years may receive one of three dose levels (25 μg, 50 μg and 100 μg). An interim analysis will be conducted to determine which dose will be used in Part 2, the placebo-controlled expansion portion of the study. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness will either be inferred through achieving a correlate of protection, if established, or through immunobridging to the young adult (ages 18-25) population. Evaluation of vaccine safety and reactogenicity is also a primary endpoint of the study. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT04796896.

Vaccinations are considered the major tool to curb the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine has demonstrated a 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. These results are now corroborated with statistical analyses of real-world vaccination rollouts, but resolving vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups is challenging. Here, applying a multivariable logistic regression analysis approach to a large patient-level dataset, including SARS-CoV-2 tests, vaccine inoculations and personalized demographics, we model vaccine effectiveness at daily resolution and its interaction with sex, age and comorbidities. Vaccine effectiveness gradually increased post day 12 of inoculation, then plateaued, around 35 days, reaching 91.2% [CI 88.8%-93.1%] for all infections and 99.3% [CI 95.3%-99.9%] for symptomatic infections. Effectiveness was uniform for men and women yet declined mildly but significantly with age and for patients with specific chronic comorbidities, most notably type 2 diabetes.

gsr2drs,2021-03-29,"I know this is the correct answer, as I mentioned in another comment. But I wonder if the vaccine's ineffectiveness on B1.351 was in the back of their mind or if it will play into any decisions in the future. 

Presumably, someone who gets the AZ vaccine will need another vaccine and it could take another year before the 2nd generation of vaccines are available that are specifically designed for B1.351 (or other variants). J&J and Novavax were both roughly 50% effective so they'll be very important stopgaps (or better). We don't know yet about  Pfizer or Moderna but hopefully we'll get news soon. I think it would be hard to get people to take the AZ vaccine, then a different first generation vaccine, then a second generation vaccine. But without that dosing schedule, B1.351 could spread just as quickly as had there been no vaccine at all in countries where everyone is given the AZ vaccine. 

The US is lucky that AZ's approval will come after nearly the whole country who wants a vaccine has already received one.

Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18–55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2–11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4% (95% CI 43·6–84·5) for B.1.1.7 and 81·5% (67·9–89·4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages.",1,0.076,0.016,0.908,0.8481

The issue is that AZ and EMA is still peddling the fact that the general incidence of this rare blood clot happening isn't higher than the general population. But two issues arise here - 


1) How do you fully confirm incidence if there is a potential reluctance to investigate or assign causality given the sensitivity of the situation and the high bar for causality.



2) While the macro incidence rate may not be higher, that doesn't really dismiss the fact that those people who died have (according to Norway and Germany) lost their lives as a direct result of side effects from that vaccine. You can't hypothesize whether they would have gotten this rare blood clot in the absence of the AZ vaccine, all we know is that they took it and had a rare reaction and died because of it.

That said, I want to know what I can and cannot say here. 

My question comes down to this: will I get banned if I disagree with a synthetic proposition the CDC issues? And it goes both ways. Can I disagree with the CDC issued guidance the vaccinated people can now spend time indoors, maskless with unvaccinated people who are low risk? Or with anyone who is fully vaccinated? Or is that unscientific because my opinion in that case runs contrary to guidance coming from the CDC? 

If the CDC comes out and says “we will not be advising lifting mandates until we see a 7 day rolling average (nationwide) of under 5000 cases a day for two weeks,” can I say it should be 10,000? 2000? 

Again, these are not straightforward questions. I know there is a whole lot of grey area here, at the intersection of science and ethics, which, thanks to these vaccines, is where we happen to find ourselves. 

Again, I understand that the vaccine is the means to the end and not the end itself. Which is exactly why I think the CDC updated guidance weeks ago saying that vaccinated people have more ability to stop socially distancing than those who don’t. And that’s because the CDC recognizes exactly what you said—that the vaccine is not the end, not the carrot on the stick, it is a way of reaching that end. And, based on their guidance, they recognize that the end most people (at the individual level) are shooting for is a “normal” life.

In total there were 269 cases of ‘Embolic and thrombotic events’ , median age was 70 years. Thirty (30) cases originated from the EEA.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was not reported as such in any of the cases.

[This Recent study](https://mbio.asm.org/content/12/2/e02648-20/article-info) looks at how Stabilisation changes to the Spike protein impact vaccine effectiveness.
The study compared the “Wild type” Spike (Oxford AstraZeneca), “PP” Spike (Pfizer/Moderna) and “DCS-PP” (J&J/Novavax)  

This [Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348625727_Native-like_SARS-CoV-2_spike_glycoprotein_expressed_by_ChAdOx1_nCoV-19AZD1222_vaccine/fulltext/600831fb92851c13fe240afc/Native-like-SARS-CoV-2-spike-glycoprotein-expressed-by-ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-AZD1222-vaccine.pdf?origin=publication_detail) by Oxford compared the impact of using native spike vs stabilized spike

IMO for those interested in pursuing spike theory this one interesting point raised in the second paper: 

> Whilst this observation that the majority of cells infected with Oxford AZ vaccine vector present pre-fusion (trimer) Spike on the cell surface it is interesting to note that a population may shed the S1 subunit. Whether this is a beneficial or detrimental feature with respect to the elicitation of immune responses during vaccination is unknown. Shedding of S1 subunits from viruses occurs during native infection, and the Oxford AZ vaccine derived S proteins mimics this native feature of the viral spike.

This could be relevant as [another recent study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252960v1) stated 


> ""spike S1 not only interacts directly with both platelets and with the key clotting protein fibrinogen and its activated form, fibrin, causing changes in the protein that, in turn, alter the way blood clots""

S1 also shown to cross Blood brain barrier. However if it was relating most predominately to spike construct; in theory we'd expect similar if not more cases announced from other vaccine e.g inactivated vaccine like Sinovac. (Not to mention natural infection, which in mass immunization campaign should be expected to show up in association with people receiving non AZ vaccine)  Granted Sinovac haven't seen huge rollouts across Europe and there isn't the same spotlight shone on Sinovac as there is on AZ, but as far as I'm aware there has been not one reported event of CVST or 'VIPIT' with Sinovac. Both the AZ and Sinovac vaccines have received large worldwide distribution 

Also, the spike theory still runs into the question of why is the reporting rate from countries like Germany so much higher than certain other countries. Say India, UK, Poland? 

The only correlation I could come up (completely back of the napkin)  is methyl-hg exposure, mostly from fish consumption. Germany has been projected as much higher risk than UK, which has lowest hypothesized risk in Europe next to Poland. The higher risk countries (like Nordic nations) all have higher incidence of these events reported and methyl-hg exposure correlates strongly with development of autoantibodies. High exposure can result in increased likelihood of development of autoummine conditions which can predispose to higher risk of thromboemobilic events and even mimic HIT in tests. 

From what we see in some data in this PRAC paper it's noted some cases had prexisting autoimmune conditions, and that was also true of some of the cases explored by the Griefswald paper.  therefore think a genetic/environmental disposition couldn't be totally ruled out, in addition to the possible theories you mention here and theories mentioned in this paper.

gt0v1yp,2021-03-31,"Before jumping to methly-hg, I would be more concerned with keeping the spike construct issue investigated. AZ also didn't have any confirmed adverse events noted by regulators in the UK despite widespread rollout and one possibility for that, since many UK towns are also high consumers of fish populations, is regulatory reluctance to assign reactions as confirmed or possible vaccine related events given the highly political nature of the AZ vaccine specifically, particularly in the UK. 



In a related vein, Sinovac hasn't had widespread rollout in developed countries and China would also have incentives not to investigate possible adverse links to clothing. Much of Sinovacs rollouts are occuring in developing nations where regulatory land apes (having worked in pharma regulation) are very different (for example, Look at the Indian Serum institute bringing a lawsuit against an individual who claimed go be hospitalized with neurological reactions after the AZ vaccine. Even if a regulatory disagrees with a complaint, a just system would never involve litigation of a civilian as an immediate reaction).



In other words, i don't think there is a sufficiently different fish consumption pattern between UK and other EU MS to warrant such a stark contrast in this rate clotting incidence, particularly where the UK is an island with no lack of fishing towns and autoimmune diseases are disproportionately high in the UK (as well as similar countries like IE). The confounding variable may very well be a more simple issue resulting from regulatory divergences in investigating or confirming possible adverse reactions, particularly given the sensitivitg of this issue in general and the added political risks for certain countries.",5,0.052,0.064,0.884,-0.5351
gsyboaj,2021-03-31,"[This Recent study](https://mbio.asm.org/content/12/2/e02648-20/article-info) looks at how Stabilisation changes to the Spike protein impact vaccine effectiveness.
The study compared the “Wild type” Spike (Oxford AstraZeneca), “PP” Spike (Pfizer/Moderna) and “DCS-PP” (J&J/Novavax)  


This [Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348625727_Native-like_SARS-CoV-2_spike_glycoprotein_expressed_by_ChAdOx1_nCoV-19AZD1222_vaccine/fulltext/600831fb92851c13fe240afc/Native-like-SARS-CoV-2-spike-glycoprotein-expressed-by-ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-AZD1222-vaccine.pdf?origin=publication_detail) by Oxford compared the impact of using native spike vs stabilized spike

IMO for those interested in pursuing spike theory this one interesting point raised in the paper: 

> Whilst this observation that the majority of cells infected with Oxford AZ vaccine vector present pre-fusion (trimer) Spike on the cell surface it is interesting to note that a population may shed the S1 subunit. Whether this is a beneficial or detrimental feature with respect to the elicitation of immune responses during vaccination is unknown. Shedding of S1 subunits from viruses occurs during native infection, and the Oxford AZ vaccine derived S proteins mimics this native feature of the viral spike.

That part stands out because a recent paper studying covid clotting events showed:

> ""spike S1 not only interacts directly with both platelets and with the key clotting protein fibrinogen and its activated form, fibrin, causing changes in the protein that, in turn, alter the way blood clots""

Source: Grobbelaar, L. M. et al. (2021). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19. medRxiv preprint. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252960v1

However if it was relating most predominately to spike construct; in theory we'd expect similar if not more cases announced from inactivated vaccine like Sinovac-  despite not being rolled out widely across Europe and not having the same spotlight shone on it it has been administered widely globally

Also spike theory wouldn't seem to sufficiently explain the disparity in reported AZ 'VIPIT' events. Majority of these cases worldwide have been reported in EEA; as highlighted in the EMA presser today despite there also being millions of under 60s innoculated outside EEA, a notably and curiously smaller number of similar events have been reported.",13,0.06,0.01,0.93,0.9313

gswi3wk,2021-03-31,">NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that, in a Phase 3 trial in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated **100% efficacy and robust antibody responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated.** These are topline results from a pivotal Phase 3 trial in 2,260 adolescents.

>“We share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “We plan to submit these data to FDA as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.”

>“Across the globe, we are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children. The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well protected by vaccination, which is very encouraging given the trends we have seen in recent weeks regarding the spread of the B.1.1.7 UK variant. It is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

>**About the Phase 3 Data from Adolescents 12-15 Years of Age**

>The trial enrolled 2,260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age in the United States. In the trial, 18 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group (n=1,129) versus none in the vaccinated group (n=1,131). Vaccination with BNT162b2 elicited SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 1,239.5, demonstrating strong immunogenicity in a subset of adolescents one month after the second dose. This compares well (was non-inferior) to GMTs elicited by participants aged 16 to 25 years old (705.1 GMTs) in an earlier analysis. Further, BNT162b2 administration was well tolerated, with side effects generally consistent with those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age.

>The companies plan to submit these data to the FDA and EMA for a requested amendment to the Emergency Use Authorization of BNT162b2 and the EU Conditional Marketing Authorization for COMIRNATY® to expand use in adolescents 12-15 years of age as quickly as possible. All participants in the trial will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

gsylb2s,2021-03-31,"This can best be analyzed with Bayesian statistics, and the end result is an 18-0 split of cases is extremely significant and gives a very solid credible interval.  Using a uniform prior and ignoring different arm sizes gives a 95% credible interval of 78.5-99.9% efficacy.

The simple way is to assume at the start there's a 50-50 chance of each case happening in each arm.  As each new case comes in, this probability can be updated using Bayes' theorem.  The end result is you find a 19/20 = 95% expectation that the next case comes in the placebo arm, equivalent to a 90/95=94.7% vaccine efficacy.  This is the same as the sunrise problem using the rule of succession.

To do the math fully, you want to assign a probability distribution to the assignment of cases.  You'd could easily start with the uniform distribution or B(1,1) (B being the beta distribution).  Then you apply Bayes theorem to update this distribution as each new data point comes in, and end up with B(19,1) as your final distribution.  The simple math is actually a special case of this, so you get the same expectation but can find a 95% credible interval (with integration to get a cumulative density function) of 82.4%-99.9%. That's percentage chance for cases to appear in each arm, which corresponds to a 78.6-99.9% vaccine efficacy.

This assumes both arms have the same size as each case appears, which is a very close approximation but not precise.  Knowing the exact arm size at each juncture allows precise math.  Also, Pfizer used a B(0.7,0.4) distribution in the final publication of their main US trial, not a B(1,1) one, which makes the results of a smaller sample far more significant and would give much higher results: 18.7/19.1 arm ratio instead of 19/20, and thus 97.9% efficacy with 87.1%-100% credible interval.

The hydroxyl is susceptible to other types of degradation, including RNAse enzymes.

>The hydroxyl is missing in DNA (this is what deoxy refers to in DNA) and as a result, DNA is very stable at room temperature, and can strongly resist degradation.

gt2y5ei,2021-04-01,"I don’t think you’re issue here is lack of sophistication when it comes to analysis, it’s pretty spot on. I think you’re falling prey to not looking at this within the context of other data we have 

The AZ trial in South Africa was comprised of around 2500 people, so roughly 3 times larger than this Pfizer study, but still quite small. The efficacy that was attained from that study was *radically* lower than what we’d come to expect from that vaccine. We also tend to act like we can’t take that study seriously because of its small size, where as in reality it was of major consequence. That study was enough for the South African government to discontinue use of the vaccine. Not an easy decision given how hard hit SA has been and very limited vaccine supply many countries have access to.

So building on that, we also have lab data indicating that both mRNA vaccines are not impacted as greatly by E484K carrying variants as AZ’s vaccine (sometimes the difference is quite dramatic) 

So with all that info, it would seem unlikely that Pfizer’s vaccine would perform as badly within the context of a small study as AZ’s did. After all, Pfizer decided to include this in a press release, I don’t think they would have done so if they didn’t have some confidence in their results. 

I would say it’s *extremely* unlikely that efficacy in a B1.135 rich environment would be 100%. It’s implausible. But given the circumstantial evidence we have plus this new study it seems rather unlikely that current mRNA offerings wouldn’t perform at least somewhat adequately in a B1.135 rich environment, or at the very least not as badly as AstraZeneca’s vaccine did. 

I think we have a tendency on this sub to dismiss small studies, where as we can definitely gleam important pieces of information from them within the context of other information.

gt6tu22,2021-04-02,">New Brunswick, NJ (April 2, 2021) – Johnson & Johnson (the Company) has begun vaccinating adolescent participants in the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

>“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on adolescents, not just with the complications of the disease, but with their education, mental health, and wellbeing,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer at Johnson & Johnson. “It is vital that we develop vaccines for everyone, everywhere, to help combat the spread of the virus with the goal to return to everyday life.”

>The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study (VAC31518COV2001) has been ongoing since September 2020, and was initially designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity (expected reactions to vaccination, such as swelling or soreness) and immunogenicity (ability to induce an immune response) of single-dose and two-dose regimens of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine candidate in healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, as well as adults aged 65 years and older. The study is now including adolescents 12 to 17 years of age.

>Among the study’s goals are to evaluate reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two dose levels of the vaccine candidate, and to evaluate potential vaccination schedules at one, two and three-month intervals in two-dose vaccine regimens.

>“Our COVID-19 vaccine candidate development program is designed to deliver on our commitment to protect people of all ages from this pandemic,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “In addition to expanding this ongoing study to include adolescents, we are in discussions with health authorities and are hard at work to initiate studies in pregnant women and children in the near future.”

>The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine candidate will initially be tested in a small number of adolescents aged 16-17 years. Following the review of initial data in this Phase 2a trial, the study will be expanded to a larger group of younger adolescents in a stepwise approach.

Excellent results! Diabolical Intranasal vaccines have been on the backbench throughout this pandemic .  Benefits of this approach are significant: 

* Easier transport/distribution and storage requirements
* Less issue with syringe supply, contamination or recycling
*  less raw vaccine material required increasing total supply
* fantastic for those afraid of needles (which likely overlaps in venn diagram with some of the anti vaccine crowd) increasing overall compliance
* Strong results are shown at local site of infection and reduction in progression further, when compared head to head with same vaccine in intramuscular format indicating favorable effect on transmission reduction
* Easy and faster to administer. Currently some poorer nations are not just experiencing issues with vaccine supply but in finding and training the appropriate number of staff to immunize individuals. These problems can be ameliorated with Intranasal candidates that could practically be self administered
* Intranasal vaccines expressing spike -- at least in comparison to IV in mouse models--  have shown several fold lower risk of crossing blood brain barrier, which was a former hypothesized concern

 Very high hopes for this one, along with other candidates like codagenix, both are in phase 1 human trials as of last month and supported by Serum Institute India. in production capacity.

gt9root,2021-04-02,"This is an adenovirus vectored candidate similar to the J&J, AZ, and Gamelaya products.  Adenoviruses almost always enter their hosts through a mucosal route, so administering them intranasally makes perfect sense.  In fact, it’s one of my main complaints about the existing AdV products.

I call it “the orthodoxy of the needle.”  A new vaccine always seems to come in a needle.  But that position actually sank Merck’s otherwise promising rVSV-based candidate (which used SARS-CoV-2 spike to enter cells) because they forgot that there isn’t much ACE2 in muscle for their vector to enter cells.  

Needles scare people and frankly I suspect that needles are a big driver of antivaccine sentiment.  They generate medical waste.  There’s a small risk of injection-site infection.  There’s a safety hazard with respect to needle sticks for healthcare workers.

gt6rewz,2021-04-02,"It does appear in the Yellow Card data the incidence of CVST specifically in AZ is notably and clearly higher (2 count of Cerebral thrombosis/CVST in Pfizer/Biontech vs 24 in AZ) confirming safety signal, however it is also under a microscrope much more. Individual vaccinees have been encouraged to look out for specific signs and symptoms with a much greater emphasis toward AZ currently and doctors too are encouraged to report any such events more heavily too. 

As some tentative clue of this spotlight effect we can see in the Yellow card data
210 accounts of ""Sneezing"" in connection with the AZ vaccine and 37 reports of ""Yawning"", vs Pfizer/BionTech: 117 counts of sneezing, 4 accounts of Yawning, despite there being no plausible biological mechanism for vector based vaccine to cause more yawning than mRNA vaccine. 

This increased scrutiny certainly doesn't invalidate the observation of CVST risk differentials, (I think it's a valid signal) but comparing reported events of the rare condition of low platelets alone not necessarily in conjunction with clots we see the following: 

**Pfizer/Biontech**

* 18 counts of immune thrombocytopenia 
* 25 counts of thrombocytopenia, 1 fatal
* 1 count of TTP
* 2 count of Thrombocytosis

Blood disorder related Adverse events total: 3204 ,1 fatal

**AstraZeneca**

* 44 counts of immune thrombocyteopenia
* 44 cases of Thrombocyteopenia, 1 fatal
* 1 count of TTP
* 1 count of Thrombocytosis

Blood disorders related adverse events total: 2411, 2 fatal

So ultimately despite the wider distribution of AZ, increased attention on it and more than twice as many adverse events reported in general  the yellow card data shows **smaller number of Blood disorder related adverse events in AZ compared with Pfizer**

 Vascular related adverse events are higher in AZ, but in neither vaccine is the associated mortality on back of this data for the UK at least pointing to justifiable reason to suspend.  We also have to consider confounding variables, for example total number of vaccinees, demographics--  more care home recipients, people in poor health anyway-- received AZ vaccine. 

Also importantly the background estimates of thromboemobilic events in general (including CVST) are sampled pre-covid and probably not a reliable estimate of true incidence this year as PRAC report notes,.    This should be an important consideration especially for regions that don't have the luxury of choosing between vaccines or have supply shortages and are facing rising infections.  CVST has been documented in clinical reports in connection with covid infection numerous times and regions that till now have avoided large waves of covid (particularly more tranmissible nd pathogenic b117 variant) might be more inclined to see these cases occur naturally now more than in the past, certainly they're more inclined to notice with ongoing media campaigns increasing awareness. 

From this adverse event report of BionTech/Pfizer we can see some similar cases that perhaps don't fit the low platelets & clot criteria directly but are similar in clinical appearance/ severity otherwise

* 11 cases of Cerebral haemorrhage (4 fatal) 
* 13 counts of Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 fatal, 
* 9 counts of Cerebral infarction,
* 16 counts of Ischaemic stroke
* 53 pulmonary embolism, 5 fatal
Etc

even for countries that DO have the luxury of choosing between vaccines presenting one vaccine as inherently safe and one as inherently dangerous by covering individual post vaccine hospitilizations in the frontpage media, provoking fear and suspending based on n=<10 (or even n=0 as is true of Canada) is slightly disingenous as any vaccine is going to be associated with some level of Illness or death regardless of what the specifics or that illness is. 

We saw this with South Korea with flu vaccinations last year, there was many calls to pause and some hysteria after 25 deaths including 17 year old 

 and likewise in Europe in 2014, similar format to what's occuring now - batch suspensions by Italy, domino effect of member state pause, then review by PRAC to calm the nerves and put into perspective the statistical number of deaths within 48 hours of vaccine anyhow during mass immunization campaigns 

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/12/novartis-flu-vaccine-hold-italy-after-suspicious-deaths

https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/no-evidence-fluad-vaccine-caused-deaths-italy

The calculation the countries that have suspended AZ now should publish is:  how many lives can be saved vaccinating with AZ vs how many lives could be saved by pausing AZ on account of specific CVST 'VIPIT' risk and instead waiting for alternatives to plug the gap, given we would expect mortality with any vaccination and greater mortality with no vaccination these calculations should be shared to the public to prove the merits of the decision. 

In the UK there has been **18.1 million AZ vaccinations with 4 CVST death vs 4 million documented covid cases and 126,000+ deaths.**, despite lower covid risk in younger people, the CVST mortality or mortality in general post vaccination would have to be quite a bit higher than it is now to justify  suspension of vaccination.  

The risk countries are taking on that have suspended the vaccine is several fold: first, if it's an issue with adenoviral vectored vaccines in general, and they switch or hold out for another vectored candidate they may also generate similar reactions and so the pause almost certainly would not result in net illness/mortality benefit if that were to be the case . 

If countries rely instead on mRNA to bridge the gap then unless they have sufficient replacement capacity in that moment they have to unavoidably absorb the natural covid related illness and mortality burden in the interim while production and delivery ramps up all the while a third, more pathogenic wave is occuring.  We then go back to having to demonstrate that this approach would reduce net illness and death.

Skipping over the specifics of occurance of other type of event in this category, and getting to more important metric, We see 49 deaths reported total in AZ relating to nervous system disorders vs 19 with Pfizer/BioNtech highlighting more events in this grouping with AZ. (There is also more reported ""yawning"" and ""sneezing"" with AZ than Pfizer despite it being implausible that Vector vs mRNA vaccine would cause this perhaps hinting at reporting bias) 

Total deaths including all category of insult 283 Biontech/Pfizer - 421 AZ

On the face of it that paints AZ as clearly 'more dangerous' but we know AZ is under the microscope specifically, with doctors and patients instructed to be on the lookout for signs and symptoms and report them Also as the summary of these analysis notes : 


> **The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness""**  

AZ especially was mostly given to care home settings and patients that were vulnerable and sick. To put these figures in perspective, here is a quick comparison with earlier reports from Norway also in older, fragile patients: out of ~45,000 people vaccinated at the time *exclusively* with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot in Norway, 33 deaths were reported.

That would translate to around 13,000 'expected' deaths scaled up directly to 18.1 million AZ vaccinated in UK assuming equal demographics.  What we see is *substantially* less, despite the majority of vaccinees still being older age group and or clinically vulnerable. 

 We must also consider that more vaccines with AZ are given than Pfizer overall, so of course there will be more deaths reported as an artifact of that.

Here is the breakdown per vaccine up to the 21st analysis cut off in latest yellow card data

> The risk of having this specific type of blood clot is very small. **Up to and including 24 March**, we had received 22 reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and 8 reports of other thrombosis events with low platelets, **out of a total of 18.1 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca given by that date**

IMO countries  blanket suspending particular vaccines across all ages (more specifically those without replacement 'own-brand' supply ready to replace shortfall) or other kind of more off topic incentivization  should consider publishing clear cost benefit model indicating roughly the amount of lives they expect to save with the decision, it's one thing if there is have available supply online and ready to replace, but for many countries there is not the luxury of saying no to millions of waiting doses and opting to choose alternate 'top shelf' vaccine and  having sufficient supply of it ready to go--  especially if In the meantime they are dealing with often much higher associated death from natural infections. 

For the UK at least, the data is still in line with background incidence, despite the increased scrutiny specific to this vaccine
It's often stated that UK did not vaccinate many young people, but this is untrue- quite a large chunk have received AZ (more than Norway total immunizations) Other regions like India have delivered covishield in high numbers to HCW. Vaccinations elsewhere are also stepping up, but perhaps the vigilance/reporting level may be lower in some region. 

 Still, as it stands from Yellow card data here have been more adverse events in 'Blood related' category against Pfizer than AZ and similar number of mortality despite less vaccinations, likewise with other conditions like Facial paralysis, which is showing up more with Pfizer than AZ. Opposite is true of vascular disorders and neurological conditions but nonetheless, looking at total mortality thus far the data does not suggest that pausing or suspending vaccination outright is likely to represent a sound decision at this point, at least in UK. 

 We will see what the EMA says on April 9th but I do tend to agree with you- and I think we should try and keep things in perspective and compare the bigger picture and also consider confounding effects carefully.  It's not so simple to look at a few events and extrapolate to hypothesized complete rollout. Nor to assume another vaccine is 100% 'safe' in comparison even if incidence of particular side effect is lower, there will be events associated with any mass immunization campaign.  We saw very similar issue in Europe in 2014 with Flu vaccines, batch suspensions , domino effect of pauses, then PRAC review. In korea last year similar calls for suspension of flu vaccine  after 25 deaths  including in 17 year old. Both were investigated and considered overall safe although the public perception was severely hampered and that caused it's own damage. 

Like you say  I don't think we can extrapolate what's seen in Norway to everywhere else at least yet-- time will see if that changes but for now hope we are careful to adopt a properly data driven and not sensationalist, hysterical or reactionary approach to this.",24,0.077,0.067,0.856,0.8225
gt9l5pb,2021-04-02,"> IgM? so you speculate these patients had a past COVID-19 infection?

Not necessarily. The body produces low levels of IgM antibody at a relatively constant rate in the absence of overt infection. This is called ""natural IgM"". Here is an [article](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vim.2019.0136) about human natural antibodies and their role in controlling viral infection and here is the abstract.

>Adaptive antibody responses provide a crucial means of host defense against viral infections by mediating the neutralization and killing infectious pathogens. At the forefront of humoral defense against viruses lie a subset of innate-like serum antibodies known as natural antibodies (NAbs). NAbs serve multifaceted functions in host defense and play an essential role in early immune responses against viruses. However, there remain many unanswered questions with regard to both the breadth of viral antigens recognized by NAbs, and how B cell ontology and individual antigenic histories intersect to control the development and function of antiviral human NAbs. In the following article we briefly review the current understanding of the functions and source of NAbs in the immune repertoire, their role during antiviral immune responses, the factors influencing the maturation of the NAb repertoire, and finally, the gaps and future research needed to advance our understanding of innate-like B cell biology for the purpose of harnessing NAbs for host defense against viral infections.

In that abstract ""adaptive antibody responses"" refers to the immune response triggered by viral infection or by immunization. In this type of response T cells induce B cells to proliferate and form germinal centers. B cells in the germinal center can switch from making low affinity IgM antibodies to making higher affinity IgG antibodies that neutralize the virus and help the body clear it. But before this adaptive response can get going, which takes at least a few days to start and about two weeks to peak, you have some degree of protection by the natural antibodies (which are mostly IgM and low affinity).

>If spike protein is activating platelets directly why has this HIT-mimicking phenomenon not been reported among the millions infected worldwide?

That is a very good question, but remember that COVID-19 is known for causing blood clots. Perhaps in some people it does cause a HIT-mimicking syndrome? But maybe you have to have a susceptibility to that kind of condition before the virus can trigger it? Alternatively, it might be that the virus doesn't trigger this HIT-type response and it does have something to do with the vaccine itself.",5,0.073,0.029,0.897,0.8764

For a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine, they replace the structural genes with the antigen of interest (SARS-CoV-2 spike in this case).  This means that the RNA will replicate within one cell but it cannot make particles and sustain an infection.

gtl6lpt,2021-04-06,"#Abstract

**Purpose**

With rapid approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect vaccine-induced antibodies with available high-throughput commercial assays is unknown. We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response.

**Methods**

This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Liaison Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralising titers. 

**Results**

225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years,; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p<0.05). Neutralising antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p<0.05).

**Conclusion**

Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralising antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting the majority of individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection.",1,0.051,0.0,0.949,0.9062

On the more sensitive live-virus focus-reduction neutralization mNeonGreen test,4 all the participants had detectable activity, with ID50 GMTs of 406 (95% CI, 286 to 578), 171 (95% CI, 95 to 307), and 131 (95% CI, 69 to 251), respectively; these GMTs were lower in participants 56 to 70 years of age (P=0.02) and in those 71 years of age or older (P=0.004) than in those 18 to 55 years of age (Figure 1; also see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).

The estimated half-life of binding antibodies after day 43 for all the participants was 52 days (95% CI, 46 to 58) calculated with the use of an exponential decay model, which assumes a steady decay rate over time, and 109 days (95% CI, 92 to 136) calculated with the use of a power-law model (at day 119), which assumes that decay rates decrease over time. The neutralizing antibody half-life estimates in the two models were 69 days (95% CI, 61 to 76) and 173 days (95% CI, 144 to 225) for pseudovirus neutralization and 68 days (95% CI, 61 to 75) and 202 days (95% CI, 159 to 272) for live-virus neutralization. As measured by ΔAICc (change in Akaike information criterion, corrected for small sample size), the best fit for binding and neutralization were the exponential decay and power-law models, respectively (see the Supplementary Appendix). These results are consistent with published observations of convalescent patients with Covid-19 through 8 months after symptom onset.5

Although the antibody titers and assays that best correlate with vaccine efficacy are not currently known, antibodies that were elicited by mRNA-1273 persisted through 6 months after the second dose, as detected by three distinct serologic assays. Ongoing studies are monitoring immune responses beyond 6 months as well as determining the effect of a booster dose to extend the duration and breadth of activity against emerging viral variants. Our data show antibody persistence and thus support the use of this vaccine in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.",44,0.058,0.033,0.909,0.9337

gtjtkfz,2021-04-06,">Saint-Herblain (France), April 6, 2021 – Valneva SE, a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need, today announced positive data for Part A of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its inactivated, adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001. Based on this data, the Company plans to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial by the end of April 2021, subject to regulatory approval.

>In study VLA2001-201, three dose levels of VLA2001 (low, medium, high), based on a schedule of two doses with vaccinations three weeks apart, were evaluated in 153 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years.

>VLA2001 was generally safe and well tolerated across all dose groups tested, with no safety concerns identified by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. There were no statistically significant differences between dose groups and no differences between first and second vaccinations in terms of reactogenicity. The majority of Adverse Events (AEs) were mild or moderate and only two subjects reported severe solicited AEs (headache and fatigue). All solicited AEs were transient. Only 17.6% of unsolicited AEs up to day 36 were considered related to the vaccine and no severe unsolicited AEs were reported. No serious related AEs were reported.

>VLA2001 was highly immunogenic with more than 90% of all study participants developing significant levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein across all dose groups tested. Seroconversion Rates (SCR) for S-protein binding IgG antibodies were 89.8% in the medium dose and 100% in the high dose group. Two weeks after completion of the two dose schedule, Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) from baseline were 26 in the medium dose and 86 in the high dose group.

>Of note, the IgG antibody response was highly correlated with neutralization titres in a micro-neutralization assay (MNA50) (r=0.79, p<0.001).

>VLA2001 induced a dose dependent response with statistically significant higher Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) for both IgG and neutralizing antibodies in the high dose group compared to the low and medium dose groups. In the high dose group, the GMT of neutralizing antibody titres measured two weeks after completion of the two-dose schedule was at or above levels for a panel of convalescent sera (GMT 530.4 (95% CI: 421.49, 667.52)).

>With a GMT ratio of vaccine vs. convalescent sera ≥ 1 vaccine efficacy has been reported above 80% for other vaccines[1].

>VLA2001 induced broad T-cell responses across participants with antigen-specific IFN-gamma producing T-cells against the S-protein, M and N protein detected in 75.6 %, 35.6% and 48.9% of study participants, respectively.",6,0.068,0.049,0.883,0.8308

gtvsrd7,2021-04-07,"Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are powerful tools to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, but vaccine hesitancy threatens these vaccines’ effectiveness. To address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and ensure equitable distribution, understanding the extent of and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy is critical. We report the results of a large nationwide study conducted December 2020-January 2021 of 34,470 users from COVID-19-focused smartphone-based app How We Feel on their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Nineteen percent of respondents expressed vaccine hesitancy, the majority being undecided. Vaccine hesitancy was significant among females, younger people, minority and low-income communities, healthcare and essential workers, rural residents, geographical regions with higher COVID-19 burden, those who did not use protective measures, and those who did not receive COVID-19 tests. Our findings support the need for targeted efforts to develop education and outreach programs to overcome vaccine hesitancy and improve equitable access, diversity, and inclusion in the national response to COVID-19",1,0.111,0.156,0.733,-0.7311

Why isn't this question being asked? Because it is an important one in the herd immunity calculation.  
And yes, I realize that there are no hard stats on previous infections, but an estimation could at least be made based on studies. It might pull the 30% down to, say, 20%, that 20% being those who were

My question is a bit speculative, I haven't seen any data linking these three. The reported rate for this condition among the people who took the AZ vaccine seems to be \~**1:100k** (through the course of \~2 months of vaccination, therefore **1:200k** per month or **5:1m** per month). And it seems to be mainly young women (of child bearing age). *(and I think the vaccinees in Europe who took the AZ vaccine could also be mainly women as well).*

According to this [paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.013617) among the general population the prevalence of Cerebral Sinus Thrombosis is **15.7:1m** per year. **\~ 1.3:1m** per month.

And according to this [paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/316/7131/589.short), this condition is observed predominantly (85%) among women using oral contraceptives. The odds ratio is reported as 13.

*Considering the high prevalence of oral contraception usage among European women, I'll assume 50% among women of child bearing age.*

*We don't really know the percentage of women among of the vaccinees, let's also assume 50% there too.*

Therefore among the vaccinees, regardless of the vaccine usage, I could calculate the share of oral contraceptions within the expected monthly prevalence as follows:

**(1.3 \* 13) \* 0.50 \* 0.50  : 1m** which is **4.2:1m** per month. Which is very close the prevalence of **5:1m** per month observed among the AZ vaccinees.

In these cases the risk of serious complications from the disease is almost certainly higher than risk of serious complications from the vaccine and so it’s considered acceptable risk. The math just becomes different when there are multiple alternative vaccines available. 

Our best reason to suspect that Pfizer and Moderna don’t have similar effects is because they’ve been given to hundreds of millions of people over the course of several months and so far (as far as I know), this side effect has not been detected.

Similar issues happen from a regulatory perspective, it is difficult to ascertain causality given the number of confusing variables and length of time til serious reactions like blood clots of neurological reactions.

Keep in mind that the UK advice to offer alternative vaccines is simply a **advice**, not a legally binding requirement. It will be interesting to see to what extent the local bodies adhere to this.



On a different point, the idea of offering alternative vaccines to only those who are under 30 yes with no underlying health conditions is strange. The EMA Signal study from last week indicated that underlying health conditions including autoimmune diseases are a possible risk factor for thrombotic adverse reactions including CST go the AZ vaccine that should be investigated further. Why put people who are already at high risk of disease at higher risk of serious adverse events from AZ vaccines when other vaccine supplies are available for them which are also more effective for that particularly vulnerable cohort. If the supplies are already available for the general population, it would seem only logical to prioritize those for the vulnerable people including younger people with underlying conditions.",5,0.046,0.102,0.852,-0.812

According to statista there are about 12.32 million people 15-30 in the UK, and males and females are about evenly split 50%/50%, so there are about 6.16m females in our under 30 age category.

According to the latest NHS statistical release April 1: ""Although there are variations by age group, overall a higher proportion of females than males have been vaccinated with at least one dose since the vaccination programme began (60.8% of females aged 16 and over compared with 52.9% of males aged 16 and over)""

https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/

So, 6.16m x 60% = about 3.7m females under 30 vaccinated with first dose

According to the Gov.uk weekly yellow card reporting as of April 1:

""As of 21 March, an estimated 10.8 million first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 15.8 million doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, had been administered""

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting

So, AZ is about 60% of all doses. 3.7M x 60% = 2.22m females under 30 vaccinated by AZ

From the MHRA press release today:

""Up to and including 31 March 2021, the MHRA had received 79 UK reports of blood clotting cases alongside low levels of platelets following the use of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca:

-Sadly, 19 people have died out of the 79 cases – 13 females and 6 males. 
-11 out of the 19 people who died were under the age of 50, 3 of whom were under 30.""

Extremely unhealthy individuals are distributed unevenly among different age groups and that, in my understanding, is the main cause of different risk distribution by age. What is the risk for completely healthy 30yo female to die from covid19? <1/1mln? <1/10mln? Certainly not higher than 1/100k.

In contrast, Moderna claims its vaccine can be maintained at most home or medical freezer temperatures for up to six months for shipping and longer-term storage. Moderna also claims its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerated conditions, of 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, for up to 30 days after thawing, within the six-month shelf life.

So to understand the risks, they look at the safety data. Were there side effects? How serious were they? Was there a lasting cost to the patient or their family? Was follow-up long enough to capture any health events that might reasonably be the result of the vaccine? If there was a serious health event in the vaccine group, is it reasonable to believe the event was unrelated to the vaccine (i.e. were the rates of such events low enough to be confident that their occurrence were coincidental rather than caused by the drug)? Was the sample size big enough to feel confident that any potential side effects that did not occur during the study are sufficiently rare that it is worth it to vaccinate this population? 

Then to understand the benefits, they look at the efficacy data. How much less severe COVID-19 illness occurred in the vaccine vs placebo group? Mild illness? SARS-CoV-2 infection? (I'm not actually sure which end points this particular trail measured, but it's likely not just severe disease since that's less common in this age group.) They might also consider data from outside of the trail to put the results in context - e.g. knowing the role this age group plays in transmission can help them consider the potential indirect protection of the vaccine, i.e., the potential to prevent disease in unvaccinated people of all ages.

gujwstk,2021-04-14,"Abstract

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in key antibody epitopes has raised concerns that antigenic evolution will erode immunity. The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted. Here we compare the specificity of antibodies elicited by the mRNA-1273 vaccine versus natural infection. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera than convalescent sera.

guh88zk,2021-04-14,"#Denmark continues vaccine rollout without AstraZeneca vaccine

##There is a link between rare but serious cases of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts and the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria®). Considering that the COVID-19 epidemic is well controlled in Denmark and that there are other vaccines available against COVID-19, the Danish Health Authority has decided to continue vaccination against COVID-19 without the vaccine from AstraZeneca.

The National Board of Health suspended the use of the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca on 11 March 2021, based on worrying signals from the ongoing safety surveillance of the COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination programme has since continued with the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.

Since 11 March, the EMA has been assessing the rare but serious adverse reactions seen following vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca. At the same time, a number of studies have been conducted in Denmark, including on the Danish cases and under the auspices of the large surveillance study of the COVID-19 vaccines, 'ENFORCE'. Danish-Norwegian registry studies have also shown that there is an over-frequency of specific adverse events, in particular cerebral venous thrombosis, following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

""Overall, we have to say that the results show that there is a real and serious adverse event signal from the AstraZeneca vaccine. Based on an overall consideration, we have therefore chosen to continue the vaccination programme for all target groups without this vaccine,"" says Søren Brostrøm, Director of the Danish Health Authority.

In its assessment, the EMA has overall found that there continue to be more advantages than disadvantages associated with the use of the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca. The Danish Health Authority agrees with the EMA's overall conclusion that AstraZeneca's benefits in combating the COVID-19 pandemic continue to outweigh the risk of serious side effects. At the same time, the EMA emphasises that the decision on whether to use the vaccine in each country depends, among other things, on the level of infection, the nature of the epidemic and whether the country has access to other vaccines.

""It has been a difficult decision in the midst of an epidemic to continue the vaccination programme without an effective and available vaccine against COVID-19. But we have other vaccines available and we have good control of the epidemic. At the same time, we are well advanced in vaccinating the older age groups, where the prevention potential of vaccination is greatest. Age is the main risk factor for becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. The future target groups for vaccination have a lower risk of a serious course of COVID-19. This has to be balanced against the fact that we now have a known risk of serious adverse effects from vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca, even if the risk in absolute terms is small,"" says Søren Brostrøm.

The decision means that everyone aged 16 or over can expect to be offered vaccination by the end of June. This means that everyone who accepts the offer could be fully vaccinated about 5 weeks after that, around the beginning of August.

The Health Authority's decision means that all booked appointments and invitations for vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine will be cancelled. Those who have received the 1st vaccination with AstraZeneca will later be offered vaccination with another vaccine. Other persons who have previously been invited for 1st vaccination with AstraZeneca but had the invitation cancelled will be re-invited based on an assessment of the current epidemic situation.

With the Health Authority's decision, at this stage, to continue the roll-out without the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, it has not been ruled out that it may be used at a later stage if the situation changes.

""We fundamentally agree with the EMA's assessment regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. It is therefore important to stress that it is still an authorised vaccine. And I understand if other countries that are in a different situation to us choose to continue its use. If we in Denmark were in a completely different situation with, for example, a violent third wave and a pressurised health system, and where we had not progressed as far in our roll-out of vaccines, I would not hesitate to use the vaccine, even if there were rare but serious complications from its use,"" says Søren Brostrøm.

Regarding the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer has quarantined the supplies, so they cannot be used in Denmark at the moment. The Danish Health Authority will closely follow the ongoing risk assessments by, among others, US and European drug authorities, and the Danish Health Authority will continue to collaborate with Danish experts to study the efficacy and side effects of all COVID-19 vaccines, including the new Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson.

gun2ej3,2021-04-15,"**ABSTRACT** 

**Background:** On March 29th, 2021, Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults pending further review of the risk for Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As a result, the province of British Columbia halted its front-line workers vaccination program which used the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province is expected to receive an additional 246,700 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through US and COVAX until April 11th, enough to provide the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line workers. It is unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines can be immediately made available to front-line workers. We evaluated the harms and benefits of delaying vaccination of front-line workers in BC. 

**Methods:** We reviewed the latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to 1) compare the expected number of deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately continuing vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines, and 2) compare the individual mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine with waiting to receive an mRNA vaccine later for different age groups. 

**Results:** We estimate that if British Columbia continues the front-line worker vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see approximately 27,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 500 fewer hospitalizations, 80 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 1,400 fewer cases of Long COVID from April 1st to October 1st, 2021, for an expected number of VIPIT-related deaths of 0.674 \[95% CI 0.414-0.997\]. In the same period and in areas of high transmission, the projected excess risk of mortality due to COVID-19 and VIPIT was significantly higher in the delayed vaccination with the mRNA vaccine scenario (3.23 to 4.44 times higher risk) than that of immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine for those between 30 and 69 years of age. For those under 30, immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine posed a higher risk than delayed vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. 

**Conclusions:** The benefits of immediately continuing immunization of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh the risk both at a societal level and at an individual risk level for those over 40, and those over 30 in high-risk areas.",6,0.038,0.061,0.901,-0.7906

gulharc,2021-04-15,"#####Abstract

> There are concerns about a possible association between vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and cerebral 
venous thrombosis (CVT, also called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; Silvis et al, 2017). The concern 
has focused primarily on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Astra Zeneca), and more recently the Ad26.COV2-S 
vaccine (Janssen). 

> The current risk with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is estimated at approximately 5 per million vaccinated individuals. Emerging data suggest that the association reflects a ‘vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia’ (VITT) (Greinacher et al, 2021; Schultz et al, 2021). Governments and medical regulators have reacted by restricting the use of the two vaccines in different subgroups of the population, based on a risk-benefit analysis

> Yet one key component of the risk-benefit calculation that is crucial to understand the context of the risk is currently unknown: the absolute risk of CVT following a diagnosis of COVID-19. To date there are only a few case reports of CVT post-COVID-19 (Dakay et 
al 2021).

> Here, using an electronic health records network, we estimated the incidence of CVT occurring in confirmed COVID-19 cases and compared this incidence to two other groups: people who received a 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, and a cohort of patients with influenza. We also compared the COVID-19 incidence to that observed in the whole network population, and with the latest estimate for the risk 
following the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, using the European Medicines Agency (EMA) data. We also examined the rate of portal vein thrombosis (PVT), another diagnosis associated with thrombosis 
in the venous system and thought to occur in VITT (Schultz et al, 2021).

That's true - but this paper chiefly does not talk about all categories of background blood clots or all categories of blood clots following COVID; that would be less helpful- and even diversionary  it primarily highlights the heightened-during-pandemic incidence rate of the same rare CVT cases (including low platelets) the EMA investigation explored with AZ and now J&J vaccine.

 EMA figures were citing pre-pandemic incidence of these rare events since that was best available data -
 Whereas this document shows the risk of CVT following COVID-19 infection is around 100 times greater than normal- R regions facing high infection rate can consider that the formerly cited background incidences of these events may therefore not reflect what will be observed this year

These data show that the incidence of CVT is significantly increased after COVID-19, and greater than that observed with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. 

Edit: also with regards to anti-PF4 antibodies, this was not specifically explored here unfortunately;  however some considerations on that front; 

* German Researchers and HIT experts that had coined VIPIT noted Anti-pf4 antibodies exist in relatively high prevalence amongst general population independent of heparin exposure (ie from  bacterial infection within last 100 days) 


* Same researchers noted in their case studies limitations several of their patients had received Heparin prior to being tested for anti-PF4 complexes, while this did not discount the link to vaccine creating or at least boosting these complexes, they had highlighted it as a caveat, many severe covid patients also receive Heparin 


* Not all of those that had experienced and had been recorded as 'VIPIT' in connection with the adenoviral vaccines had tested positive for anti-PF4. 
dutch study of 5 cases of thromboses and thrombocytopenia for example showed in 2 of the 5 patients no antibodies were found for anti-PF4. in many of the cases reported PF4 status hasn't been concretely confirmed but those cases - at least in Europe are still cited as 'CVST' etc rather than not being counted, so that's something to be mindful of in comparisons-- if the US data on these vaccine associated events under investigation were to be conditional upon positive anti-PF4 assay (is that the case?)",8,0.086,0.037,0.877,0.9791

gv73md0,2021-04-19,"This is a rundown by Dr. Patrick Kearns. It explains why adenovirus vectored vaccines lead to ongoing immune stimulation by persisting in the cells they infect and how they are different from mRNA vaccines (not fully quoted here), whose antigen gets digested quickly and there’s no ongoing production of it. Unfortunately, I can’t link the source due to the community’s rules, but it’s just a google search away. 

>After the first dose mRNA you imagine that germinal centres are established. Great vis here [image]. But then they have no ongoing stimulation. Waiting 3/12 could be good, bad, or neutral in the long term. But it surely leaves 2+ months of partial immunity.

>Now adenovirus vector vaccines:
It is a different story for these. Here the DNA coding for the spike is introduced into an adenovirus that is missing one or a few genes to make it capable of forming intact viral particles (E1,E3 usually). But it can still transcribe mRNA. These viruses set up camp in the nucleus. Like other persistent DNA viruses, they're unbelievably sneaky and it's not that well understood how they do this. They will continue to make mRNA and protein until infected cells are killed by cytotoxic T cells. This is similar to how a replication defective strain of EBV is used to make lymphoblastoid cell lines. Double-stranded DNA viruses like adenoviruses set themselves up in the nucleus and transcribe RNA from there. And they can last a very long time doing this (years). So for adenovirus vector vaccines your immune system will likely be receiving continued exposure to the spike protein. 

>This is most likely (imo) why the delayed second dose of AZ gives a bigger immune response overall. More time between doses means more RNA transcribed...
...and protein translated and presented to the immune system. And therefore, a more (affinity) mature immune response at the time of second challenge.
It is also why the Johnson&Johnson vaccine (which will hopefully be effective) is able to be designed as a single dose. 
Because whilst it is only one dose, it manipulates the hobbled adenovirus to work for a long time after the injection. And exposure over time is important.


>An obvious way to see that adenovirus works on a different timescale from other respiratory viruses is to look at respiratory pathogen surveillance during lockdowns this year.
‪https://syndromictrends.com/metric/panel/rp/percent_positivity/organism/main…‬
All the others disappear quickly, but adenoviruses persist.
That's because people will test positive in respiratory samples for adenoviruses that got established in their tonsils when they contracted it months or years previously. This is quite unlike the respiratory RNA viruses.

>""Natural"" SARS2 infection:
Antigen presentation probably occurs after SARS-2 infection for weeks or months too.
Defective viral particles continue to be presented to the immune system in gut and lung long after a person has stopped being infectious.
Evolution of Antibody Immunity to SARS-CoV-2
biorxiv.org

>This sort of time scale for the immune response with natural infection is probably recapitulated to some extent with other vaccine technologies, e.g. attenuated viruses. 
Where there is presentation of antigen to the immune system over a longish period of time.
This is why I really really dislike the lumping of the mRNA vaccines in with the AZ vaccine. 
And references to the AZ vaccine delay being a rationale for delaying the mRNA second dose make me particularly uncomfortable. I don't think we should expect it to be similar.
A single dose of mRNA is quite unlike the immune challenge you would get from either an adenovirus vaccine or natural infection.

>Relevant to this thread: Published today in

. Johnson and Johnson Adenovirus vaccine looks pretty good for immunogenicity. Clear logistic advantages to a single dose. As expected, looks like effects of a single dose continue to accumulate over time.

gv9raxq,2021-04-20,"Summary

Background

CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion spike protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system being developed against SARS-CoV-2. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.
Methods

This phase 1–2, randomised, double-blind study is being done in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in ten clinical research centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18–49 years and ≥50 years) and randomly assigned using an interactive response technology system with block randomisation (blocks of varying size) to receive one dose (on day 1) or two doses (on days 1 and 22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing low-dose (effective dose 1·3 μg) or high-dose (2·6 μg) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline) or unadjuvanted high-dose antigen (18–49 years only). Primary endpoints were safety, assessed up to day 43, and immunogenicity, measured as SARS-C0V-2 neutralising antibodies (geometric mean titres), assessed on days 1, 22, and 36 serum samples. Safety was assessed according to treatment received in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose. Neutralising antibody titres were assessed in the per-protocol analysis set for immunogenicity, which included participants who received at least one dose, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, had no protocol deviation, had negative results in the neutralisation test at baseline, and had at least one valid post-dose serology sample. This planned interim analysis reports data up to 43 days after the first vaccination; participants in the trial will be followed up for 12 months after the last study injection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04537208, and is ongoing.

Findings

Between Sept 3 and Sept 29, 2020, 441 individuals (299 aged 18–49 years and 142 aged ≥50 years) were randomly assigned to one of the 11 treatment groups. The interim safety analyses included 439 (>99%) of 441 randomly assigned participants (299 aged 18–49 years and 140 aged ≥50 years). Neutralising antibody titres were analysed in 326 (74%) of 441 participants (235 [79%] of 299 aged 18–49 years and 91 [64%] of 142 aged ≥50 years). There were no vaccine-related unsolicited immediate adverse events, serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events classified as severe, or adverse events of special interest. Among all study participants, solicited local and systemic reactions of any grade after two vaccine doses were reported in 81% (95% CI 61–93; 21 of 26) of participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 93% (84–97; 74 of 80) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 89% (70–98; 23 of 26) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 95% (88–99; 81 of 85) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 29% (10–56; five of 17) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 21% (8–40; six of 29) in the placebo group. A single vaccine dose did not generate neutralising antibody titres above placebo levels in any group at days 22 or 36. Among participants aged 18–49 years, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 13·1 (95% CI 6·40–26·9) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 20·5 (13·1–32·1) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 43·2 (20·6–90·4) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 75·1 (50·5–112·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 5·00 (not calculated) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group. Among participants aged 50 years or older, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 8·62 (1·90–39·0) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 12·9 (7·09–23·4) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 12·3 (4·35–35·0) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 52·3 (25·3–108·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group.

Interpretation

The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age groups, and the high reactogenicity after dose two were probably due to higher than anticipated host-cell protein content and lower than planned antigen doses in the formulations tested, which was discovered during characterisation studies on the final bulk drug substance. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.",1,0.042,0.047,0.911,-0.0516

gv7cnaa,2021-04-20,"# Background

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 rarely causes vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) that—like autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia—is mediated by platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies.

# Methods 

We investigated vaccine, PF4, and VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 antibody interactions using dynamic light scattering, 3D-super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze vaccine composition. We investigated the mechanism for early post-vaccine inammatory reactions as potential co-stimulant for anti-PF4 immune response. Finally, we evaluated VITT antibodies for inducing release of procoagulant DNA-containing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and measured DNase activity in VITT patient serum. 

# Conclusions 

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine constituents (i) form antigenic complexes with PF4, (ii) EDTA increases microvascular permeability, and (iii) vaccine components cause acute inammatory reactions. Antigen formation in a proinammatory milieu offers an explanation for anti-PF4 antibody production. High-titer anti-PF4 antibodies activate platelets and induce neutrophil activation and NETs formation, fueling the VITT prothrombotic response.",12,0.032,0.012,0.956,0.4427

To clarify, my initial response to you was more directed at heparin vs argatroban. The article that you linked likely overestimated their Type 2 HIT rate since they did a PF4 antibody test (ELISA or PaGIA) without a confirmatory serotonin release assay. Also, the severity of trauma from surgery is known to correlate with higher HIT rates (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19965682/), so the incidence of HIT in the cardiac surgery population likely overestimated the general population. That being said, I'm not criticizing you for citing that paper. I don't think there's any literature out there that substantiate the true incidence of Type 2 HIT in the general population, and I think the article you linked provides a useful data point. 

Really, all I'm saying is there's no need to default to argatroban because the incidence of Type 2 HIT is really low. Its incidence is likely somewhat overestimated because people either stop at the 4 T's or a PF-4 antibody test without confirming with a serotonin release assay (which I can understand since it takes most places 3-5 days to get an SRA test back, whereas a PF-4 takes 24 hours on a bad day). Additionally, argatroban has its own drawbacks: it's expensive, it annoyingly messes up the INR assay, its dosing is really sensitive in liver disease, and the nurses will hate you because of the 2-hour titration schedule and slightly-different coagulation monitoring. 

That last point about the nurses is probably most important. 2-hour titrations sound great clinically until you find out that you wrecked the nursing workflow in a step-down unit. If that happens, you better be buying cupcakes for weeks to get back on their good side.",2,0.08,0.049,0.871,0.8723

Emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of clinical concern. In a cohort of 417 persons who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine at least 2 weeks previously, we identified 2 women with vaccine breakthrough infection. Despite evidence of vaccine efficacy in both women, symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 developed, and they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Viral sequencing revealed variants of likely clinical importance, including E484K in 1 woman and three mutations (T95I, del142–144, and D614G) in both. These observations indicate a potential risk of illness after successful vaccination and subsequent infection with variant virus, and they provide support for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection and to characterize variants in vaccinated persons.

gvg5h5e,2021-04-21,"IIRC asymptomatic and symptomatic people have similar viral loads (though I can't remember if this is nasal or something else). I think the salivary viral load was thought to be a better predictor of viral load deep in the lungs, however, and was found to be correlated with disease severity (I guess not in the case of patient 1 here). It also appears that organ impact (ground glass opacities and heart damage) happens quite frequently in both mildly-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (though it's mild too), so I sort of go by the rule of thumb that just because you don't have symptoms, doesn't mean you got off free. I too wish I had an explanation for this, but I got nothing...

My understanding around antibodies is their volume in the bloodstream and across other locations is important; the more antibodies, the more they can bind to the virons floating around (neutralize). You're right that with recent vaccination (patient 1), she should have had these neutralizing antibodies ready to go (indeed, her antibody titers in the paper show that), versus someone further out time-wise who will have a T cell response or something that would need to generate these neutralizing antibodies first.

gvgiad3,2021-04-21,"No, it wouldn't be within expected numbers actually. To assess that, we need to calculate the expected numbers and compare them to this study (see details below).

TL;DR: this study does not confirm what we know about vaccine efficacy and breakthrough rate, actually it contradicts some other estimates. But the sample is too small to mean anything, could be noise.

&#x200B;

Detailed Explanation:

The study says that 2 people out of 417 got Covid in a vaccinated group, in a 3-months window of observation.

To better understand this data, we can ask ourselves:

**on average, how many people out of a ""similar""(same risk/exposure)** ***non-vaccinated*** **group of 417 people got Covid, in the same 3-months window?**

If the answer to the latter were 2, that would mean the vaccine makes no difference. It would naively put the efficacy rate at 0% and breakthrough rate at 100% (all of this with *low confidence* due to small numbers).

This is an extreme example to clarify that the above comment that says that it is ""darn good"" does not take in account what proportion of people were actually exposed to Covid in the group.

Can we answer the question in bold above? The problem is finding a similar non-vaccinated group,  we need a randomized trial for that, which was not done in the study (might be almost unfeasible).

Without a proper randomized trial, we can look at the baseline of CDC data for NY in January-March 2021 (the 3-months window in question).  If we take a solomonic average of 40 cases per 100k per day, this corresponds to 3600 infections in 90 days for a 100k group of people, which is **15 out of 417**. This would suggest a breakthrough rate of 13% and an efficacy rate of about 86.7% (*with extremely low confidence, this is key. We are comparing 2 subjects to 15, it's too small of a sample*).

Disclaimer: this is a very broad estimate, infections per 100k vary micro-locally in NY.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In conclusion, this study does not confirm what we know about vaccine efficacy and breakthrough rate, actually it contradicts some other estimates. But the sample is too small to mean anything, could be noise. On a side note, the fact that such a short 2-pages study was co-authored by 15 PhDs tells you something about the state of academia nowadays (I'll do anything for a citation!).",11,0.05,0.043,0.907,0.7737

The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2–negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe–critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ≥14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ≥28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe–critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19–related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19–related).

CONCLUSIONS

A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe–critical disease, including hospitalization and death.

The way it is reported the 42% number is made out to be low. It is low for what we have seen for BNT162b2 , but two weeks after the first dose is early, earlier than the timing of most studies. 7 days after second dose is also early. My guess is that this is all in line with what has been previously established, but I would love to get more input on that.

**Background:** Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 needs to be assessed in diverse real-world population settings.

**Methods:** A cohort study of 805 741 residents in Scania county, Southern Sweden, aged 18-64 years, of whom 26 587 received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Incidence rates of COVID-19 were estimated in sex- and age-adjusted analysis and stratified in two-week periods with substantial community spread of the disease. 

**Results:** The estimated vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection >7 days after second dose was 86% (95% CI 72-94%) but only 42% (95% CI 14-63%) >14 days after a single dose. No difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between females and males. Having a prior positive test was associated with 91% (95% CI 85 to 94%) effectiveness against new infection among the unvaccinated.

**Conclusion:** A satisfactory effectiveness of BNT162b2 after the second dose was suggested, but with possibly substantially lower effect before the second dose.",15,0.059,0.044,0.897,0.5362

    From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the“v-safe after vaccination health checker” surveillance system

So the data is only from around two months since pregnant people can receive the vaccine. Obviously most who gave birth to a baby in this period of time had to receive the vaccine in the third semester.

The study goes then on and says:

    Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester)

So there are not only 827 participants but 3958, of which 3131 still have an ongoing pregnancy. The numbers in Table 4 is only about completed pregnancies though. Since most of the people receiving the vaccine are still in an ongoing pregnancy there isn't a complete picture yet, but as the scientists concluded:

    Early data from the v-safe surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the VAERS do not indicate any obvious safety signals with respect to pregnancy or neonatal outcomes associated with Covid-19 vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Once everyone has a level of protective immunity, the protection would be almost lifelong - quite possibly ""boosted"" by reexposure now and then throughout one's life. I say almost lifelong because even regular coronaviruses can be lethal for the particularly vulnerable (see the OC43 outbreak in an old folks residence during the SARS crisis). This happens naturally to all of us when we're exposed to these endemic viruses as kids, and there are good reasons to think it would happen to kids exposed to sars-cov-2. 

It's also unlikely we could ever get down to a true zero cases. Especially considering sterilizing immunity does not last very long and variants seem to defy sterilizing immunity (but not protective immunity). Of course, perhaps one day better vaccines could emerge.

If we eliminated the virus and it came back 25 years later (as animal reservoirs could remain), we'd also possibly have another pandemic on our hands. Obviously vaccine production could be much better and faster then, but we might have way more people to vaccinate.

Of course I could be all wrong in the above and you could be right, maybe the protection from vaccination will be short-lived and the IFR would remain high. I think that going through the efforts that would be required (mandatory and frequent immunization, massive vaccine deployment in all developing countries, ensuring every single country participates as just one human reservoir would rapidly ruin everything, continuous isolation efforts of positive cases, and all this for who knows how long, etc.) without even knowing if there's any chance it would work, seems dangerous to me.

>BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines have been rapidly rolled out in the UK from December, 2020. We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.

>**Methods**

>The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged ≥18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.

>**Findings**

>23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0–54·1) and 19 692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. **A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55–85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74–96) 7 days after two doses in the study population.**

>The decision was made based on data collected and evaluated by the technical teams of the general management of Medicines and Biological Products (GGMED), Sanitary Inspection and Inspection (GGFIS) and the Monitoring of Products Subject to Health Surveillance (GGMON). The General Management of Ports, Airports and Customs Enclosures (GGPAF) and the Office of International Affairs (Ainte) also participated in the survey.

He pointed out that the Agency is known for making access to medicines and vaccines feasible and that, in this pandemic moment, the institution has acted at the limit, but that there is no flexibility in relation to product safety.

>The rapporteur also stated that Anvisa's daily challenge is to establish whether the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks related to the product. “Security is an inalienable aspect in the face of risk uncertainty. We got here hand in hand with science and supported by evidence ”, said the director.

>To date, 14 states have sent import orders for the Sputnik V vaccine to Anvisa: Acre, Alagoas, Amapá, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Sergipe and Tocantins, in addition to the municipalities of Maricá and Niterói in Rio de Janeiro.

It was also verified the absence of reproductive toxicity tests, which allow to verify if the product may or may not be harmful to the reproductive cells.  

>In its analysis, GGMON reinforced aspects pointed out by GGMED, but drew attention especially to the question of the lack of knowledge of adverse effects in the short, medium and long term resulting from the use of the vaccine.

>**Oversight**

>The Inspection area has also detected a number of problems related to the Sputnik V vaccine, including as a result of an inspection mission sent to Russia.

Not even in the phase 3 interim results, not in the official data sheet. 
This is from the phase 3 [interim report] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00234-8/fulltext):

>These characteristics make recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccines suitable candidates for the WHO target product profiles for long-term protection of people at high risk of COVID-19 in outbreak settings because they stimulate rapid onset of protective immunity.

They never specifically describe **their** vaccine vector as replication-deficient, they just mention that replication-deficient  adenovírus vectored vaccines are suitable candidates against covid-19. This seems like very sneaky language (possibly intentionally employed to mislead?).

And this is apparently the official [data sheet] (https://55v3ckrflgw3sg2kfsaqwiijsa-ac5fdsxevxq4s5y-medum-ru.translate.goog/sputnik-v). Not one mention of it being replication-deficient or otherwise.

The FDA for instance is going to break Emergent's (the contract manufacturing org for J&J/Janssen) back over their vector swap issue (won't link as it's news).

gw73lld,2021-04-28,"Testing for replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) is a requirement of many regulatory authorities for the reasons the blog mentions.  Production is by growing the recombinant virus on the helper cell line and there is always the very small chance that the recombinant could recover the excised genes it needs for replication (those are replaced by the S gene form SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccine strain) from that cell line by homologous recombination.  The more generations the virus is grown, the higher the risk as the RCA can certainly grow on the helper cell line.

To reduce the risk, culture is done by tiered seeds.  A part of the initial master virus seed (MVS) culture is expanded and split into working virus seeds (MVS) that are then sampled to seed production cultures thereby minimising the number of generations for each production batch.  You really want clean seeds to minimise risks.

You can see how the EU regulator dealt with this issue when communicating with Astra-Zeneca on [Vaxzevria](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/vaxzevria-previously-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf).  AZ did not submit RCA testing data and were told in no uncertain terms to produce it (page 17).  The regulator subsequently reviewed the data and the seed and production testing protocols for RCA before approval.  The Brazilian Anvisa report seems to say that Gamaleya had a lax RCA specification.  If the Anvisa report is accurate, it is most unlikely the Gamaleya vaccine could pass muster with the EMA either.",90,0.088,0.03,0.882,0.9107

And if it’s the former, the whole coding sequence for the spike protein would have been substituted for the E1 and we wouldn’t get any anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity from it, right? So I highly doubt they wouldn’t be especially careful about that, as their vaccine would probably lose efficacy while gaining higher reactogenicity/adverse effects.

Honestly, I find it really odd that no official document (to my knowledge) from gamaleya (product data sheet, phase 3 interim analysis) especifically refers to Sputnik V as a replication-deficient vector vaccine (or replication-competent, for that matter).

Replicating vector is a big problem for two reasons: 

* it’s not meant to do that; adenovirus vector viruses are meant to be sterile platforms that hijack your body’s protein factories without replicating (see also AZ and J&J - no one has accused them of replicating). So something went badly wrong in the production and QC process. You’re infecting people with a replicating adenovirus!
* Adenovirus infections are known to cause uncommon but very serious complications and you don’t really want to inject them into healthy people. Especially the Sputnik adenoviruses which might possibly be very bad as infections (no one knows nor wants to find out)

gw95m8a,2021-04-28,"Ok... but still, this is not an “official document” and, unlike Ox/Az and J&J, they never unequivocally say “Gam-COVID-Vac is a non-replicant recombinant SARS-CoV-2 adenovirus vectored vaccine”, or something along these lines. Note the wording of the [paper] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00234-8/fulltext) from their phase 3 interim analysis: 

>These characteristics make recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccines suitable candidates for the WHO target product profiles for long-term protection of people at high risk of COVID-19 in outbreak settings because they stimulate rapid onset of protective immunity.

[...]

>Gam-COVID-Vac is a combined vector vaccine, based on rAd type 26 (rAd26) and rAd type 5 (rAd5)—both of which carry the gene for SARS-CoV-2 full-length glycoprotein S (rAd26-S and rAd5-S).

A bit sneaky, I would say. They are just stating that non-replicant adenovirus vectored vaccines are suitable covid-19 vaccine candidates, but don’t 100% clearly say that’s the platform of **their** vaccine. They never specify the genes deleted/substituted from the vector either. Like on their webpage, they just make general remarks. In fact, they say “the gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed“. This is innacurate and if it is indeed replication-deficient, it should have said “the gene from adenovirus, which ~~causes the infection~~ **enables replication**, is removed. There’s not one mention of replication competence on what I believe is their official [data sheet] (https://55v3ckrflgw3sg2kfsaqwiijsa-ac5fdsxevxq4s5y-medum-ru.translate.goog/sputnik-v) either. 

See how this contrasts with Ox/Az’s phase 1/2 preliminary [report] (https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140-6736(20\)31604-4): 

>The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) consists of the **replication-deficient** simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx1, containing the full-length structural surface glycoprotein (spike protein) of SARS-CoV-2, with a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 expresses a codon-optimised coding sequence for the spike protein (GenBank accession number MN908947).

gwbp4qd,2021-04-29,"**COPENHAGEN, Denmark, April 29, 2021** – Bavarian  Nordic A/S today reported additional preclinical  data for the capsid virus-like particle (cVLP) COVID-19 vaccine  candidate, ABNCoV2, confirming its ability to induce neutralizing  antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Bavarian Nordic previously reported preclinical data, showing that  two doses of non-adjuvanted ABNCoV2 led to >50-fold higher titers of  neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (Wuhan) virus when  compared to titers  measured in convalescent human samples, and this  translated into protection from a challenge with wild-type virus. A  neutralization test of samples from the study has now confirmed  similarly high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV2  variants B.1.1.7 (British) and B.1.351 (South African). These are highly  encouraging results as it has been reported that high levels of  neutralizing antibodies are highly predictive of protection (Khoury et  al. doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252641).

“We are pleased to confirm the strong antibody response against  emerging and more concerning variants of SARS-CoV2 for our COVID-19  vaccine candidate,“ said Paul Chaplin, President and Chief Executive  Officer of Bavarian Nordic. “No approved COVID-19 vaccine, including  those based on mRNA technology, have shown the same levels of immunity  against the main circulating strain (Wuhan) and the South African  variant and if these results are confirmed in the on-going clinical  study, then we might be looking at the first universal COVID-19  vaccine”.

Bavarian Nordic licensed ABNCoV2 from AdaptVac in 2020, and earlier  this year, a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial was initiated at the Radhoud  University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, one of the members of the  PREVENT-nCoV consortium which is funded by a Horizon 2020 EU grant.  Bavarian Nordic has decided to further advance the development of  ABNCoV2 by investing in a Phase 2 clinical trial and to scale up  manufacturing in preparation for further clinical development towards  licensure. Planned to start in the second quarter of 2021, the Phase 2  study will investigate the ability of ABNCoV2 to boost existing immunity  through prior vaccination, to create a more durable immune response  that could protect against the current circulating variants of COVID-19.  In parallel the Company continues to seek funding to further progress  the candidate through Phase 3 towards licensure.",1,0.09,0.003,0.906,0.9827

>In light of the massive and rapid vaccination campaign against COVID-19, continuous real-world effectiveness and safety assessment of the FDA-authorized vaccines is critical to amplify transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes. In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). **This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%)** in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent authorization of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, there are not yet enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform.

gwt5ow2,2021-05-02,"I had a thought last night that perhaps somebody here could answer. Maybe or maybe not.  Idk.

I know they chose the ChAdOx1 adenovirus at least in part due to it’s extremely low seroprevalence in human population. Also, if I understand this correctly, this adenovirus has low immunogenicity and thus the immune system is slow to create immunity to it. Third, this family of adenovirus is extremely good at inducing cytotoxic T-Cell reactions with the human body reacting rather violently in terms of inflammation and other potential side effects?

But... how long does it take for humans to develop immunity to the viral vector? I imagined that either the dose was so low that this non-replicating viral vector hijacks a certain number of cells, and the immune system doesn’t encounter antigens from the ChAdOx1 vector, or maybe it does develop immunity over time.  I’m starting to think it takes awhile to develop immunity, but if you keep on giving yourself the vaccine, maybe the body would eventually recognize the vector? I’m thinking probably not from 3 doses over 4-months. 

I understand the human version of this adenovirus was tried unsuccessfully in creating an HIV vaccine. And of course it was successful for a couple other viruses that they were going to use it for, but ultimately, the cost was prohibitive and it was saved. I thought that they had also tried using them to deliver mostly gene therapy and failed potential cures for some diseases.

So, I was asked by someone, what would happen if they took 3 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in a four month window. My natural thought was to say that their bodies would quickly kill off either the adenovirus or the spikes would be neutralized within a few days. I realized that since the adenovirus creates a rather strong T-cell reaction, that cytokines would be produced in reasonable quantities that they might trigger an inflammatory response, etc. 

But then I stopped myself from saying that to the person. I wondered about immunity to viral vectors, potential damage to the liver and spleen(unlikely since the virus is non-replicating.) Would they develop other rare reactions? I know that it is almost certainly toxic at high does but how high? In all honesty, my thought was to tell the person that probably nothing would happen, and in fact, the person could potentially have some level of  neutralizing antibodies to spike proteins still present.  And that they might have another inflammatory reaction. 

I’m not quite 100% sure as I’m not an immunologist. I had heard that there were a fair number of adenoviruses they’ve discovered to be used as viral vectors and that, this is the first time it has been used on this scale. Before sars-cov-2, they had done some small scale experimentation, but despite the prevailing thoughts of these viruses as an old tried and true method, the adenovirus viral-vector type virus had only limited use, mostly failed, and is not in actuality a commonly used vaccine technology. I’m not aware of it’s use in any other commercially available vaccine.",3,0.094,0.069,0.836,0.8874

T cells are critical for control of viral infection and effective vaccination. We investigated whether prior Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) or Tetanus-Diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccination elicit cross-reactive T cells that mitigate COVID-19. Using co-cultures of antigen presenting cells (APC) loaded with antigens and autologous T cells, we found a high correlation between responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Spike-S1 and Nucleocapsid) and MMR and Tdap vaccine proteins in both SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and individuals immunized with mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The overlapping T cell population contained effector memory T cells (TEMRA) previously implicated in anti-viral immunity and their activation required APC-derived IL-15. TCR- and scRNA-sequencing detected cross-reactive clones with TEMRA features among the cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2, MMR and Tdap epitopes. A propensity-weighted analysis of 73,582 COVID-19 patients revealed that severe disease outcomes (hospitalization and transfer to intensive care unit or death) were reduced in MMR or Tdap vaccinated individuals by 38-32% and 23-20% respectively.

gx30wob,2021-05-05,"Summary

Background

Following the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine.

Methods

We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant.

Findings

During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3% (95% CI 94·9–95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91·5% (90·7–92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 97·0% (96·7–97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 97·2% (96·8–97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 97·5% (97·1–97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 96·7% (96·0–97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94·5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Interpretation

Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (≥16 years, including older adults aged ≥85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.",6,0.026,0.08,0.894,-0.9809

BACKGROUND

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. In a phase 1–2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS

In this phase 2a–b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 μg of recombinant spike protein with 50 μg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS

Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, −0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS

The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.",6,0.067,0.038,0.895,0.8957

With single dose estimated effectiveness of 92.1%, we combine this knowledge with corresponding antibody levels to model and estimate the long-term durability of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Additionally, we integrate studies about differences in antibody neutralization to SARS-CoV-2 variants to understand how variants can affect the durability of the vaccine. The estimated days after first injection for binding antibodies to fall below levels of those from day 15 is 411 days. The estimated days after first injection to fall below the lower limit of detection of 20 GMTs is 327 days for pseudovirus neutralization and 461 days for live virus neutralization. Our model has pseudovirus neutralization against variant B.1.351 falling below 20 GMT on day 100; variant P.1 on day 202, variant B.1.429 on day 258; and variant B.1.1.7 on day 309. The data used contains many limitations including the small sample size with older age bias, sensitivity of the neutralization assays, and limited data on variants. Still, we believe mRNA-1273 two dose vaccine can provide over a year of protection against COVID-19 from the initial D614G variant. It is likely by the second year, protection against COVID-19 will fall below single dose efficacy. Therefore, there should be consideration for a booster shot a year after the first set of vaccines. If there is an observed increase in variants with higher resistance such as B.1.351 and P.1, a booster vaccine against the newer variants should be considered to increase protection against resistant variants",7,0.017,0.027,0.956,-0.128

The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class of vaccines.",9,0.147,0.02,0.834,0.9601

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of their mRNA vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. Data to support the BLA will be submitted by the Companies to the FDA on a rolling basis over the coming weeks, with a request for Priority Review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA will be set once the BLA is complete and formally accepted for review by the agency.

>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is currently available in the U.S. under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA on December 11, 2020. Since then, the Companies have delivered more than 170 million doses of the vaccine across the U.S. Submission of a BLA, which requires longer-term follow-up data for acceptance and approval, is the next step in the rigorous FDA review process. 

>“We are proud of the tremendous progress we’ve made since December in delivering vaccines to millions of Americans, in collaboration with the U.S. Government,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “We look forward to working with the FDA to complete this rolling submission and support their review, with the goal of securing full regulatory approval of the vaccine in the coming months.”

>“Following the successful delivery of more than 170 million doses to the U.S. population in just a few months, the BLA submission is an important cornerstone of achieving long-term herd immunity and containing COVID-19 in the future,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “We are pleased to work with U.S. regulators to seek approval of our COVID-19 vaccine based on our pivotal Phase 3 trial and follow-up data.”

>Pfizer and BioNTech initiated the BLA by submitting the nonclinical and clinical data needed to support licensure of the COVID-19 vaccine for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. This includes the most recent analyses from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, where the vaccine’s efficacy and favorable safety profile were observed up to 6 months after the second dose. The Companies will submit the required manufacturing and facility data for licensure in the coming weeks to complete the BLA. 

>Pfizer and BioNTech also have submitted an application to expand the current EUA for their COVID-19 vaccine to include individuals 12 to 15 years of age.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected.

Background Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are still urgently needed as only 5% of the global population has been vaccinated. Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full-length Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 when given to adults at high-risk of exposure.

Methods INO-4800 was evaluated in 401 participants randomized at a 3:3:1:1 ratio to receive either INO-4800 (1 mg or 2 mg dose) or placebo (1 or 2 injections) intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA® 2000 at Days 0 and 28. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04642638

Findings The majority of adverse events (AEs) were of Grade 1 and 2 in severity and did not appear to increase in frequency with the second dose. The number of participants experiencing each of the most common AEs did not differ appreciably between the two dosing groups. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of binding and neutralizing antibody levels were statistically significantly greater in the 2.0 mg dose group versus the 1.0 mg dose group. The T cell immune responses measured by the ELISpot assay were also higher in the 2.0 mg dose group compared to the 1.0 mg dose group.

Interpretation INO-4800 at both the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses when administered in a 2-dose regimen appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in all adult ages. However, the comparative immunogenicity analysis favored selection of INO-4800 2.0 mg dose for advancement into a Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.",3,0.058,0.018,0.924,0.8417

A positive anti-S IgG ELISA was seen in 76.1% (16) of patients following vaccination with positive neutralising antibodies detected in 85.7% (18) of patients. A memory T cell response was observed in 80% (16) of patients, with a CD4+ T cell response in 75% (15) and a CD8+ T cell response in 35% (7). These results, for the first time, provide some reassurance regarding the initial immune response to the BNT162b2 vaccine amongst patients with MPN, with response rates similar to that observed in the general population.",3,0.101,0.027,0.871,0.926

Aims

To explore variables associated with the serological response following COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine.

Methods

Eighty‐six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID‐19 were enrolled in January–February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1–4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual‐energy‐X‐ray absorptiometry.

Results

Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = −0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non‐smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender.

Conclusions

Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID‐19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS‐CoV‐2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID‐19, it is well‐established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules",11,0.027,0.043,0.93,-0.4939

>**Background**

>Recent reports demonstrate robust serological responses to a single dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Data on immune responses following a single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are however limited, and current guidelines recommend a two-dose regime regardless of preexisting immunity.

>**Methods**

>We compared spike-specific IgG and pseudo-neutralizing spike-ACE2 blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 following two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and a single dose of the adenovector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 232 healthcare workers with and without previous COVID-19.

>**Findings**

>The post-vaccine levels of spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and all three variants of concern were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both < 11 months post infection (n=37) and ≥ 11 months infection (n=46)) compared to participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=149).

>More than a year after emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple first-generation vaccines are approved and available for vaccination. Still, many challenges remain. The ongoing vaccination programs across the globe suffer from insufficient vaccine supply. The virus is adapting to the human host and novel variants are circulating that are neutralised less efficiently by antibodies raised against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we describe CV2CoV, a second-generation mRNA vaccine developed for enhanced protein expression and immunogenicity. CV2CoV supports increased levels of protein expression in cell culture compared to our clinical candidate CVnCoV. Vaccination with CV2CoV induces high levels of virus neutralising antibodies with accelerated kinetics in rats. Robust antibody responses are reflected in significant cross-neutralisation of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, i.e. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.

gxz5p9k,2021-05-13,">CureVac N.V. (Nasdaq: CVAC), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), today announced together with its collaboration partner GSK, first preclinical data in a rat model, showing that its second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, induces high levels of antigen production as well as strong and dose-dependent immune responses in vaccinated animals. CV2CoV is a co-development between CureVac and GSK and is based on a new mRNA backbone, which differs from CureVac’s first-generation vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, currently in late-stage clinical testing. Preclinical data in rats immunized with CV2CoV in the dose range of 0.5-40µg demonstrated fast onset of strong immune responses already after the first dose. In addition, the serum of vaccinated animals showed significant cross-neutralization against variants first discovered in Denmark (B.1.1.298), the UK (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351). The full manuscript of the preclinical data is available on the pre-print server bioRxiv.

>“mRNA technology has made tremendous progress since the clinical development of first-generation mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates started in early 2020, “ said Dr. Igor Splawski, Chief Scientific Officer of CureVac. “Spurred by the emergence of virus variants that have the potential to affect the efficacy of currently approved first-generation mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, CureVac and GSK aim to jointly develop second-generation vaccine candidates that offer improved immune responses and target emerging variants. Combined with lower doses, these second-generation vaccines could enable also broad protection against selected strains in a multivalent vaccine format.”

>Roger Connor, president R&D GSK vaccines said ”to successfully fight the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term, we will need different vaccines and we need to be able to respond effectively to emerging variants. We are pleased with these pre-clinical results as they show the potential of the next generation mRNA technology we are developing together with CureVac.”

>CV2CoV is based on a new mRNA backbone that features targeted optimizations designed to improve intracellular mRNA stability and translation for increased and extended protein expression. These optimizations potentially allow for strong immune responses at low doses, which will support the development of multivalent vaccines to target rapidly spreading COVID-19 variants. First clinical trials for CV2CoV are expected to start in the third quarter of 2021.

>Development of CV2CoV is carried out in collaboration with GSK. The CureVac-GSK COVID-19 collaboration announced in February 2021 extends the existing strategic mRNA technology partnership both companies entered in July 2020.

gxzft4m,2021-05-13,"> Interesting backstory here as this is a Canadian mRNA vaccine but has not received any support from the Canadian government. 

That backstory is completely false, though. They have received government support on multiple occasions, including some $10 million already given to them through Canada's National Research Council, and are included in the list of domestic firms to which the NRC's Industrial Research Assistance Program has already confirmed that additional support for Phase II trials will be made available. 

The idea that they have not received any support at all is being perpetuated by the firm's huckster CEO (Sorenson), who seems to believe that the government not having agreed to provide him with ~$150 million up front is the same as him being cruelly ignored. This is in spite of the support already described above, and the fact that he is routinely able to address parliamentary committee hearings to issue his demands. It is nakedly deceitful for him to keep insisting to credulous media outlets that the government won't return his calls when in fact he is able to directly address lawmakers almost at a whim. They just aren't interested in dumping that kind of money into a company that has no relevant production record, that did not initially have any means of producing the planned vaccines, that would be relying on ingredients sourced from another company (Northern RNA) that also has no significant history, and whose only other active projects are prospective cancer vaccines that they describe as being ""still in the discovery phase."" 

The basis for *those* vaccines may also call the company into doubt, seeing as Sorensen's most notable public activity in this space prior to COVID was [to be implicated in a vaccine IP plunder scandal](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/28/1454760/0/en/Arcturus-Therapeutics-Issues-Open-Letter-to-Shareholders.html) that saw the CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics fired from his own company and Sorenson himself accused of multiple ethics breaches and suspicious trading activity.

I was hoping these results would be posted here by someone because they deserve to be critically examined. If they're legitimate, and this vaccine seems like it should be promising, great -- but there is ample reason to wonder.",0,0.083,0.132,0.785,-0.9647

Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class of vaccines.",1,0.147,0.02,0.833,0.9601

What is already known about this topic?

Health care personnel (HCP) are at high risk for COVID-19. The early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP provided an opportunity to examine vaccine effectiveness in a real-world setting.

What is added by this report?

The first U.S. multisite test-negative design vaccine effectiveness study among HCP found a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to be 82% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 and 2 doses to be 94% effective.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among U.S. HCP. High vaccination coverage among HCP and the general population is critical to prevent COVID-19 in the United States.",3,0.145,0.042,0.813,0.9357

Background: Covid-19 vaccines are urgently needed, especially against emerging variants. NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 rS) nanoparticle vaccine containing trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant. 


Methods: A phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults 18-84 years old who received two intramuscular 5-mcg doses, 21 days apart, of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (1:1) across 33 sites in the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologically confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative participants. 


Results: A total of 15,187 participants were randomized, of whom 7569 received NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received placebo; 27.2% were 65 years or older, 44.7% had comorbidities and 4.2% had baseline serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. There were 10 cases of Covid-19 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients and 96 cases among placebo recipients, with symptom onset at least 7 days after second vaccination; NVX-CoV2373 was 89.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 94.6) effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. There were five cases of severe Covid-19, all in the placebo group. Post hoc analysis revealed efficacies of 96.4% (73.8 to 99.5) and 86.3% (71.3 to 93.5) against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was similar across subgroups, including participants with comorbidities and those ≥65 years old. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. 


Conclusion: A two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 conferred **89.7% protection** against a blend of prototype and variant Covid-19, demonstrated high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant, and had a reassuring safety profile.",44,0.059,0.067,0.874,0.2023

>Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in India designated B.1.617 and B.1.618 have mutations within the spike protein that may contribute to their increased transmissibility and that could potentially result in re-infection or resistance to vaccine-elicited antibody. B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations Δ145-146, E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies. The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a 4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618 variants.",23,0.026,0.0,0.974,0.5423

So the vaccine makes the cells display Spike on their surface. When expressed, Spike by default will be at prefusion. Only when it binds to a receptor, like ACE2, will it change to postfusion. In the stabilized form, it will not change its conformation to postfusion.

Although antivirals are important tools to control the SARS-CoV-2 infection, effective vaccines are essential to control the current pandemic. Plant-derived virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates have previously demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy against influenza. Here we report the immunogenicity and protection induced in macaques by intramuscular injections of VLP bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoVLP) vaccine candidate formulated with or without Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) or cytosine phosphoguanine (CpG) 1018. Although a single dose of unadjuvanted CoVLP vaccine candidate stimulated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, booster immunization (at 28 days after prime) and adjuvants significantly improved both responses with a higher immunogenicity and protection provided by AS03 adjuvanted CoVLP. Fifteen microgram CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 induced a balanced IL-2 driven response along with IL-4 expression in CD4 T cells and mobilization of CD4 follicular helper cells (Tfh). Animals were challenged by multiple routes (i.e. intratracheal, intranasal and ocular) with a total viral dose of 106 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2. Lower viral replication in nasal swabs and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as fewer SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and immune cell infiltrates in the lungs concomitant with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors in BAL were observed in the animals immunized with CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03. No clinical, pathologic or virologic evidences of vaccine associated enhanced disease (VAED) were observed in vaccinated animals. CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was therefore selected for vaccine development and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND

Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

METHODS

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose.

RESULTS

Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.

CONCLUSIONS

A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.",4,0.066,0.025,0.908,0.9291

How so? It shows that the efficacy is low or non-existent, definitely lower than with the previous variants. The estimate is very imprecise, but it's not meaningless.  


> without acknowledging none of the variant related outcomes were anywhere near statistical significance  

The conclusion clearly states that the vaccine ""did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant"".",6,0.154,0.071,0.775,0.794
gyvurdb,2021-05-20,"> Non-significant results (which is what we have here) don't (on their own) indicate that the sample size was too small. They are taken to indicate no change, difference or effect.  

They tend to be taken as that, but that's a wrong interpretation. Lack of statistical significance is still consistent with a range of non-zero differences between interventions (or intervention and placebo). In this particular case, I'd say it's very implausible that the there is no vaccine effect at all. The point estimate (10%) remains its most likely value (most consistent with the data), even if 0 is likely enough not to reject it.  

[Equivalence between interventions in clinical trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18537788/) is established differently. You first define the smallest difference that would be clinically meaningful and then test a null hypothesis that the true difference is greater than that. In practice, this is done by checking that the 95% CI doesn't contain values above that minimum difference threshold. If we wanted to use this method in the case of AZ trial with 50% efficacy as the minimum (which was a regulatory threshold for covid vaccines from the FDA), we wouldn't be able to conclude that there is no meaningul difference between the vaccine and placebo (because the 95% CI goes above 50%).  

But, as I've said before, I don't think the hypothesis testing / statistical significance approach is very useful in interpreting research results.",2,0.099,0.066,0.836,0.866

gyzbds8,2021-05-21,"UK SAGE committee, published 21 May:

“Executive Summary
1. SARS-CoV-2 is evolving antigenically. Some variants are less well neutralized by antibodies raised to current vaccines, and the vaccine efficacy against these variants is lower than for matched virus.
2. Administration of further doses of the current vaccine, which is based on the spike protein from the Wuhan-like virus that emerged in 2019, might maintain and/or boost protection into winter 2021/22, but potentially less so for individuals with a less robust immune response, and less so if substantially antigenically variant viruses circulate widely. Eventually it is likely that the virus will display sufficient substantial antigenic variation and current vaccines will fail to protect against transmission, infection, or even against disease caused by newer variants.
3. Loss of vaccine effectiveness will result in further economic and social costs.
4. A solution is to update vaccines to keep pace with virus evolution, and the newer, more flexible vaccine platforms are particularly suitable for this approach.
5. Additional potential solutions are to invest in developing new vaccination strategies that could induce stronger T cell responses since T cell epitopes might vary less over time.

6. Another strategy would be to search for more broadly protective vaccines, including
 universal vaccine candidates, multivalent vaccines, and heterologous prime-boost strategies

7. We should also consider whether future vaccination policy will aim to immunize the whole population or only those at risk from severe disease, and how this might be impacted by the long-term accumulation of baseline immunity in the population and long-term evolution of the virus.

8. Effective vaccine updates require coordinated virus and immunity surveillance as well as an effective relationship between public health bodies and the vaccine manufacturers, and an integrated international approach that will integrate into the WHO.”",9,0.11,0.047,0.843,0.9564

The term vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) was coined to reflect this new phenomenon. In vitro experiments with VIPIT patient sera indicated that high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) competitively inhibit the platelet activating properties of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induced antibodies. Here, we report a case of a 62-year-old woman, who had received this vaccine and developed VIPIT. She visited the emergency ward because of petechiae and hematomas. In the laboratory work-up, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer, and positivity in the platelet factor 4/heparin-enzyme-immunoassay were present. Signs and symptoms of thrombosis were absent. Upon immediate therapy with non-heparin anticoagulation, high dose IVIG, and prednisolone laboratory parameters steadily improved and the patient was discharged from hospital without thrombotic complications.

**Background** 

Although the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have proven high efficacy, limited data exists on the duration of immune responses and their relation to age and side effects.

**Methods**

We studied the antibody and memory T cell responses to Spike protein after the two-dose Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 122 volunteers up to 3 months and correlated the findings with age and side effects.

**Findings**

We found a robust antibody response after the second vaccination dose. However, the antibody levels declined at 6 and 12 weeks postvaccination, indicating a waning of the immune response. Regardless, the average levels remained higher compared to pre-vaccination or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. The antibodies efficiently blocked ACE2 receptor binding to Spike protein of four variants of concern at one week but this was decreased at three months, in particular with B.1.351 and P1 isolates. 87% of individuals developed Spike-specific memory T cell responses, which were lower in individuals with increased proportions of immunosenescent CD8+ TEMRA cells. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, suggesting a detrimental impact of age on outcome.

**Interpretation**

The mRNA vaccine induces a strong antibody response to four variants at 1 week postvaccination but decreases thereafter, in particular among older individuals.

gzducz0,2021-05-25,">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 25, 2021-- Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that the Phase 2/3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) in adolescents has met its primary immunogenicity endpoint, successfully bridging immune responses to the adult vaccination. In the study, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in participants who had received two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using the primary definition. In addition, a vaccine efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants was observed starting 14 days after the first dose using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for milder disease. This study, known as the TeenCOVE study, enrolled more than 3,700 participants ages 12 to less than 18 years in the U.S. The Company plans to submit these data to regulators globally in early June.

>“We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents. It is particularly exciting to see that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We will submit these results to the U.S. FDA and regulators globally in early June and request authorization. We remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

>In this Phase 2/3 study, 3,732 adolescent participants ages 12 to less than 18 years were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to two 100 µg doses of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The primary endpoint of non-inferior immunogenicity versus the Phase 3 adult study comparator group was met. After two doses, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult Phase 3 COVE study, compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting 14 days after the second dose. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescents, a secondary case definition based on the CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder symptoms. Using the CDC definition, which requires only one COVID-19 symptom and a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, a vaccine efficacy of 93% after the first dose was observed.

>mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adults. No significant safety concerns have been identified to date. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills.

>Safety data continues to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second injection to assess long-term protection and safety. Consequently, these data are subject to change based on ongoing data collection. The Company plans to submit data from the TeenCOVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.",25,0.071,0.046,0.883,0.9313

Sinus venous thrombosis has been linked to immunization with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. The initial trigger for this serious adverse event has not been determined. We analyzed the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine by biochemical and proteomic methods. We found that the vaccine, in addition to the adenovirus vector, contains substantial amounts of both human and non-structural viral proteins. Among the human proteins, heat-shock proteins and cytoskeletal proteins were particularly abundant. The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities. A linkage to later immune-related adverse events is also conceivable. The here reported identification of specific classes of protein impurities should guide and accelerate efforts to increase the purity of the vaccine and increase its safety and efficacy.",17,0.09,0.061,0.849,0.6235

gzjerw4,2021-05-26,"#Abstract

**Background:** Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have provided an invaluable resource in the fight against this infection. Given the current vaccine shortage, vaccination programs must prioritize their distribution to the most appropriate segments of the population. 

**Methods:** We carried out a prospective cohort study with 63 health care workers (HCWs) from a public General Hospital. We compared antibody responses to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between HCWs with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (experienced HCWs) and HCWs who were not previously infected (naive HCWs).

**Results:** Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (>50 AU). The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p<0.001) 

**Conclusion:** The study shows that 10 months after the disease has passed, the immune system is capable of producing a rapid and powerful secondary antibody response after one single dose of the vaccine. This response reflects the persistence of immunological memory and it is independent of whether or not anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in blood. Besides, we found that the second dose does not improve the antibody response in individuals with previous Covid-19 infection. Nonetheless, two months later, the persistence of antibody levels is still higher in the experienced HCWs. These data suggest that immune memory remains for a long time in recovered individuals, and therefore, vaccination in this group could be postponed until immunization of the rest of the population is complete.",8,0.08,0.062,0.857,0.7976

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Until very recently, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had not been authorized for emergency use in persons younger than 16 years of age. Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity.

METHODS

In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 μg of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, ≥7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed.

RESULTS

Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100).

CONCLUSIONS

The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19.

>Several studies have shown that individuals with previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection had boosted antibody response after single dose of mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines. We wondered whether single dose CoronaVac, a whole-inactivated vaccine, could be considered for COVID-19 survivors in Indonesia. We measured IgG anti-RBD titre among 18 survivors and 37 non-survivors. Among survivors, there were 9 survivors with positive antibody titre (seropositive) before vaccination and 9 seronegative survivors. All respondents received two doses of CoronaVac vaccine at 14-days interval. We found no significant antibody titre difference between non-survivor at 14 or 28 days after second dose as well as seronegative survivor at at 14 days after second dose. Seropositive survivors were rapidly boosted after first dose with higher antibody titer than non-survivors and seronegative survivors after second dose. However, antibody titer did not differ between first and second dose among seropositive survivors. Seropositive COVID-19 survivors could receive single dose of CoronaVac vaccine which could potentially ease the vaccine supply constrain. A long-term follow-up must be conducted to observe difference in antibody response and persistence.",2,0.084,0.009,0.907,0.9203

**Objectives**

Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have been introduced. To investigate whether the vaccine provides protective immunity effectively, the amount and function of vaccine-induced antibodies were evaluated.

**Methods**

Sera from 13-17 days after the second dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine were collected from healthcare workers at the University of Toyama (n=740). Antibody levels were quantitatively measured by the anti-receptor binding domain antibody test (anti-RBD test), and neutralising activity against pseudotyped viruses displaying wild-type (WT) and mutant spike proteins (B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants) were assayed using a high-throughput chemiluminescent reduction neutralising test (htCRNT). Basic clinical characteristics were obtained from questionnaires.

**Results**

Antibodies were confirmed in all participants in both the anti-RBD test (median 2112 U/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 1275-3390 U/mL) and the htCRNT against WT (median % inhibition >99.9, IQR >99.9 to >99.9). For randomly selected sera (n=61), 100.0% were positive for htCRNT against the B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants. Among those who answered the questionnaire (n=237), the values of the anti-RBD test were negatively correlated with age for females (p<0.01; r = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.45 to -0.16). Systemic symptoms after vaccination were related to higher values of the anti-RBD test (median 2425, IQR 1450 - 3933 vs. median 1347, IQR 818 - 2125 for no symptoms; p<0.01).

**Conclusions**

The BNT162b2 vaccine produced sufficient antibodies in terms of quality and quantity which could neutralise emerging variants. Antibody induction can be affected by age and sex but will still be at a sufficient level.",3,0.04,0.025,0.935,0.5647

h0621se,2021-06-01,"The Coronavac, applied in 27,1 thousand residents of the municipality, localized in the region of Ribeirão Preto protected vaccinated and non vaccinated, creating a collective “immunological belt” against the virus, reducing drastically its transmission, as revealed by the unprecedented study in the world. 

The immunization of all the adult population of the municipality of Serrana, in the countryside of São Paulo, with the Butantan´s CoronaVac caused a great reduction of 80% of the symptomatic cases and 95% of deaths after the second vaccination of the last group of the city (please see the trust gap in the end of the text). 

This is the main conclusion of the clinical study of effectiveness - named “Project S” - an unprecedented study in the world, coordinated by the Institute that is related to the Government of São Paulo. 

The reduction was stated by the comparison of the data from the beginning of the project until the vaccination of all the groups was completed - with all the trimester evaluated (february, march and april of 2021). 

The results also showed that the vaccination protects not only the adults that received the two doses of the immunization but also the children and teenagers with less than 18 years old who were not vaccinated. 

This proves that the intervention made in the city by Butantan created in it a true “immunological belt” with a collective barrier against the virus, drastically reducing the transmission in the municipality. 

Another important conclusion of the research is the incidence of the disease in Serrana in comparison with the nearby cities. Serrana has around 10 thousand residents that works  in Ribeirão Preto daily. However, while Ribeirão Preto and others cities in the region are presenting high levels of COVID-19 cases, Serrana maintained low taxes if compared to the cities with similar profile, due to the vaccination. 

In other words, the success of the vaccination was confirmed not only by the decrease in the number of infected people but also showed that the residents of Serrana that goes daily from one city to another did not bring a relevant increase in the number of cases. 

Between February 17 and April of this year, during 8 weeks, around 27 thousand residents of the municipality received the completed vaccination scheme: two doses of the Coronavac with a gap of 28 days between the first and second doses. This represents a coverage of approximately 95% of the adult population of residents, according to the health census made previously by Butantan. 

The research, conducted by Butantan Institute and approved by the ethical and sanitary authorities, counted with the partnership of the Medical School of USP in Ribeirão Preto and with the Municipal Government of Serrana. 

The method used for the clinical trial is called stepped-wedge trial. The city was split in 25 sub areas forming four populacional groups, named clusters and identified by colors - green, yellow, gray and blue - which received the immunizing following this order. The vaccine was offered to all residents aged over 18 years eligible to the study in these areas, sequentially and in four degrees. 

The study also concluded that the two last populacional groups participating on the vaccination were already benefiting from the reduction of the transmission of the virus generated by the immunization of the residents of the two first groups. 

The medical director of the clinical research of Butantan Institute, Ricardo Palacios, who also directed the study, explains that the sequential scheduling permits the evaluation of the four vaccinated areas. 

“We understood that the phenomena observed did not happen randomly, but it repeats in the four groups in different moments' ' explains. “The most important result was understanding that we can control the pandemics even without vaccinating all the population. When reaching the coverture of 70 to 75%, the degree in the incidence was detected even in the group that had not completed the vaccination scheme already” completes. 

According to Palacios, the clinical trial also confirmed the indirect effect of the vaccination, since it was possible to prove the protection of populations that were not vaccinated, such as the children. “ The reduction of the cases in people who did not receive the vaccine indicates the degree of the virus circulation. This enforces vaccination as a public health measure and not only an individual action” says the director of the study. 

The municipality of Serrana was chosen to host the project and presents, by the time, a high level of prevalent infections by COVID-19 and by the fact that it has a regional hospital. The goal was to study the epidemiological impact of the vaccination on the adult population group, regarding the contention of the pandemic. 

The vaccine was applied upon the volunteering participation of the residents. People attended to receive the immunizing in previously scheduled dates. 

“The important conclusions of this study can support the strategies of immunization not only in Brazil but throughout the world, and it offers hope in the control of the pandemic with vaccines as the Coronavac, which was developed in partnership of the chinese pharmaceutical Sinovac with Butantan” states the president of the Institute, Dimas Covas. 

According to the scientist and professor, the study of phase 4 proves the efficiency of the vaccine as a collective health strategy. The clinical trials of the phase 3, made between july and december of 2020, had already assured the efficacy of the immunizing, with varying levels between 50,7% to 62,3% to symptomatic cases and from 83,7% to 100% in occurences that demands any medical assistance. 

“The vaccine is secure, effective, efficient, has a high level of quality and contributes to prevent the development of the disease, complications and deaths between the infected. We also know now that it causes beneficial effects in a whole population, protecting the vaccinated, the non vaccinated and significantly reducing the virus circulation.” concludes the president of Butantan.

We show the vaccine, dry-coated on the patch is thermostable, and delivery of spike via HD-MAP induced greater cellular and antibody immune responses, with serum able to potently neutralize clinically relevant isolates including those from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, a single dose of HD-MAP-delivered spike provided complete protection from a lethal virus challenge, demonstrating that HD-MAP delivery of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is superior to traditional needle-and-syringe vaccination and has the potential to greatly impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

>**Design**: Cohort study

>**Setting**: Roll-out of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in Denmark Participants: 864,096 individuals who were first inline to receive the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine: 46,101 long-term care facility (LTCF) residents, 61,805 individuals 65 years and older living at home but requiring practical help and personal care (65PHC), 98,533 individuals ≥85 years of age (+85), 425,799 health-care workers (HCWs), and 231,858 individuals with comorbidities that predispose for severe COVID-19 disease (SCD).

>**Intervention**: vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine

>**Main outcome measures**: RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 related admissions within 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause admission, COVID-19 related death within 30 days after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and all-cause death.

>**Results**: Beyond 7 days after the second dose, the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection in all groups ranged from 53-86%. In 65PHC, HCW and SCD, we observed a substantial reduction in risk of infection 0-7 days after the second dose ranging from 46-71%. The VE against COVID-19 related admissions ranged from 75-87% in all groups except +85 and HCWs where no events occurred. For COVID-19 related deaths, a significant VE was observed in LTCF residents (VE of 89%) and 65PHC (VE of 97%), whereas no events were observed in the three remaining groups. VE against all-cause death ranged from 26-73% in all groups except HCW where an insignificant VE was estimated.

In addition, neutralisation titres against B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), are induced in these boost regimens.

h1clj4c,2021-06-10,"Abstract

Importance 

The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates reported in Phase 3 trials varies from ∼45% to ∼95%. It is important to explain the reasons for this heterogeneity.

Objective 

To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Sources 

ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO, McGill and LSHTM trackers of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, peer reviewed publications, and press releases were searched until March 31st, 2021.

Study Selection 

All RCTs reporting efficacy outcomes from Phase 3 trials till March 31st, 2021 were included. Of the 11 vaccine candidates that had started their Phase 3 trials by November 1, 2020. Phase 3 efficacy outcomes were available for 8 vaccine candidates. (PROSPERO CRD42021243121).

Data Extraction and Synthesis 

Both authors independently extracted the data required from identified sources, using PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included all RCTs reported in peer reviewed publications and publicly available sources. A random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimator was used to summarize the treatment effects. Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures 

SARS-CoV-2 infections per protocol in vaccine and placebo groups, risk ratio, prevalence of the COVID-19 infection rate in the populations where the Phase 3 trials were conducted.

Results 

8 vaccine candidates had reported efficacy data from a total of 20 independent Phase 3 trials, representing a total of 221,968 subjects, 453 infections across the vaccinated groups and 1,554 infections across the placebo groups. The overall estimate of the risk-ratio is 0.24 (95% CI, 0.17-0.34, p < 0.01), with an I2 statistic of 88.73%. The meta-regression analysis with pandemic prevalence as the moderator explains almost half the variance in risk ratios across trials (R2=49.06%, p<0.01).

Conclusion and Relevance 

Pandemic prevalence explains almost half of the between-trial variance in reported efficacies. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates declines as the pandemic prevalence increases.

Question 

Does the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic explain the heterogeneity in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates?

Findings

Almost 50% of the variance in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials can be explained by differences in COVID-19 infection rate prevailing across trials. Efficacy of evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls significantly with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic across trial sites.

Meaning 

Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates needs to be interpreted in conjunction with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjustment for location-level prevalence analysis would provide better insights into the efficacy results of Phase 3 trials.",1,0.021,0.032,0.947,-0.3818

h1c0wl8,2021-06-10,"I'm actually a little confused by the phrasing of your first question, but I'll tentatively answer yes and explain as best as I understand it. For every additional 20% of the total population (including those under 16) who are vaccinated, the unvaccinated population (still including U-16s) saw their rate of covid halved... hopefully I don't make it more confusing.

So, let's say hypothetically the rate of covid was 100 cases per day, in a population of 100,000 people. When 20% of the people were ""instantly"" vaccinated you observe the case count drop not from 100 to 50 cases per day, you take out the 20% who now have effectively zero cases, the rate of the case rate stays the same initially (remember this is a hypothetical instant vaccination) for the other 80,000 at 80 cases per day, but over time that would drop to 40 cases per day. You vaccinate another 20,000 instantly and it drops from 40 to 30 because you remove those vaccinated (this time the 20k people are 25% of the unvaxxed pop), and then over time it halves to 15. Vaxx another 20k, instant drop to 10 cases and over time it halves to 5 cases. Now you've got 60% of the population vaccinated, and 5 cases per 40,000 unvaccinated instead of the 40 cases per 40,000 you had before the vaccinations started.

Hope that helped! Also hope I read it correctly.

As for the population question, the whole population starts unvaccinated, and vaccines are administered in the usual basis to everyone eligible over 16. The under 16's serve as a control, assuming their behavior mimics the behavior of the rest of the group as they go about getting vaccinated and mask laws and other NPIs are relaxed.

*Capitalizing on differences in vaccination rates among geographically distinct communities, and on the availability of an unvaccinated bystander cohort of individuals below 16 years of age for whom the vaccine was not authorized in the first stages of vaccine rollouts, we asked whether and to what extent the fraction of patients vaccinated in each community affects the risk of infection in an unvaccinated cohort of individuals under 16 years old within this same community.*",15,0.073,0.038,0.889,0.9593

We describe the response to IVIG therapy in three of the first patients in whom VITT was identified in Canada after the receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The patients were between the ages of 63 and 72 years; one was female. At the time of this report, Canada had restricted the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine to persons who were 55 years of age or older on the basis of reports that VITT had occurred primarily in younger persons. Two of the patients in our study presented with limb-artery thrombosis; the third had cerebral venous and arterial thrombosis. Variable patterns of serum-induced platelet activation were observed in response to heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), indicating the heterogeneity of the manifestations of VITT in serum. After the initiation of IVIG, reduced antibody-induced platelet activation in serum was seen in all three patients. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.)",2,0.032,0.014,0.954,0.3818
h19bffq,2021-06-10,"**Abstract**

With the development of high-efficacy vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, an urgent open question is whether currently available vaccines protect with similar efficacy against infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). Recent reports quantifying the extent by which VOC can evade vaccine immunity resulted in a range of estimates for the same VOC, which makes them difficult to interpret. One possible explanation for the discrepancies between different studies is an inconsistency in terms of the time post-vaccination of the sampled population. Here we present a model based on the observed correlation between antibody neutralization levels and vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the impact of time post-vaccination on the comparison of the vaccine efficacy for VOC versus non-VOC infections. Our model predicts and exemplifies several possible consequences for vaccine efficacy in VOC infections: 1) a delay in the onset of vaccine efficacy against VOC; 2) a transient increase in susceptibility to breakthrough infection with VOC compared to non-VOC as a function of time after vaccination. We review preliminary data indicating that such phenomena are observed in studies of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. We find that ignoring the strong dependence on the time post-vaccination can lead to contradictory reports of relative efficacy against VOC versus non-VOC, with implications on mitigation strategies against VOC and the design of vaccine efficacy studies.",6,0.044,0.043,0.913,0.0258

Specific memory B cells and antibodies are reliable read-out of vaccine efficacy. We analyzed these biomarkers after one and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. The second dose significantly increases the level of highly-specific memory B cells and antibodies. Two months after the second dose, specific antibody levels decline, but highly specific memory B cells continue to increase thus predicting a sustained protection from COVID-19. We show that although mucosal IgA is not induced by the vaccination, memory B cells migrate in response to inflammation and secrete IgA at mucosal sites. We show that first vaccine dose may lead to an insufficient number of highly specific memory B cells and low concentration of serum antibodies thus leaving vaccinees without the immune robustness needed to ensure viral elimination and herd immunity. We also clarify that the reduction of serum antibodies does not diminish the force and duration of the immune protection induced by vaccination. The vaccine does not induce sterile immunity. Infection after vaccination may be caused by the lack of local preventive immunity because of the absence of mucosal IgA.",9,0.055,0.041,0.903,0.3956

h1nj19k,2021-06-13,">GAITHERSBURG, Md., June 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced preclinical and clinical data on the company's original recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, and for a new vaccine directed against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) variant, which was originally identified in South Africa. The data show that the vaccines demonstrated strong immunogenicity and protection against both the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, which was originally identified in the United Kingdom, and the Beta (B.1.351) variant as well as the original SARS-CoV-2 in animal and human studies. A preprint of the manuscript, 'Immunogenicity and In vivo protection of a variant nanoparticle vaccine that confers broad protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants,' is available at bioRxiv.org and has been submitted for peer review.

>""While current vaccines are effective against selected SARS-CoV-2 variant strains, newly emerging variants are also being identified that have the ability to overcome vaccine induced immunity,"" said Matthew Frieman, PhD, Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who collaborated on these studies. ""This work demonstrates that variant vaccines that protect against these newly emerging variants have the potential to be highly effective and may produce broader protection against variants we know of and those that will arise in the future. Clinical trials will provide further evidence on the effectiveness of variant vaccines.""

>The studies compared the Beta (B.1.351)-directed vaccine to Novavax' prototype vaccine candidate as standalone, in combination, and as heterologous prime boost vaccine. The findings show a broad array of cellular and humoral responses in animal models against all virus strains evaluated. The Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variant strains have created public health concerns due to increased transmission rates and lower efficacy of current vaccines seen against Beta (B.1.351).

>""These data suggest that not only could one booster dose of this variant-directed vaccine potentially provide a robust, protective immune boost after vaccination against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also the potential to provide broad protection against various virus strains if used as a primary vaccine regimen,"" said Gregory M. Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development, Novavax. ""This broad immune coverage is vital to controlling the pandemic as variants of concern continue to emerge worldwide that could jeopardize the protection created through ongoing COVID-19 vaccination efforts.""

>**Study 1: Immunogenicity and Protection in Mice**

>Mice were immunized with NVX-CoV2373 or rS-B.1.351 alone, in combination, or as a heterologous prime boost. Mice vaccinated with any of the four regimens displayed elevated antibody titers against both the original and Beta (B.1.351) spike. Heterologous or bivalent vaccination is highly immunogenic against the prototype spike compared to monovalent approaches, while immunization with monovalent rS-B.1.351 or bivalent spike resulted in the highest anti-B.1.351 spike IgG titers among regimens tested.

>Additionally, mice immunized with rS-B.1.351 alone produced elevated neutralizing antibody titers to the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) strains compared to titers upon immunization with the prototype-directed strain. Titers were similar in the heterologous and bivalent vaccine groups.

>Antibodies produced after vaccination with rS-B.1.351 inhibited binding between human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (hACE2) and the variant spike or original spike to the same degree. This indicates that rS-B.1.351 can efficiently protect ""backward"" against original SARS-CoV-2 strains. In contrast, NVX-CoV2373 was less efficient at protecting ""forward"" against the Beta (B.1.351) variant strain.

>Whether immunized with prototype vaccine or rS-B.1.351 alone, in combination, or as a heterologous prime boost, mice were protected when challenged with live Alpha (B.1.1.7) or Beta (B.1.351) variant strains of SARS-CoV-2.

>**Study 2: Anamnestic Response in Baboons**

>A cohort of baboons that were originally immunized with prototype vaccine were boosted approximately one year later with one or two doses of rS-B.1.351. Seven days after the first rS-B.1.351 boost, those that originally received adjuvanted prototype-directed vaccine exhibited a strong immune response, with anti-Spike IgG titers that were higher than the peak immune response observed during the primary immunization series. The rS-B.1.351 boost elicited comparable antibody titers against original and rS-B.1.351 spike.

>Further, the same cohort exhibited a strong neutralizing response to Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) strains and hACE2-inhibiting antibody response following the boost, despite having undetectable titers before the boost. High neutralizing antibody titers were observed seven days post-boost, demonstrating ""a robust, durable antibody response even one year after the primary vaccination series."" These results suggest that one dose of a variant-directed vaccine may be sufficient for boosting regimens after previous immunization with a COVID-19 vaccine based on the original spike strain.

>**Study 3: Robust Antibody Response in Humans**

>NVX-CoV2373 is currently being studied in multiple clinical trials, including in locations where Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variant strains are widespread. Thirty randomly selected human serum samples from Phase 2 clinical trial participants after their second dose of the vaccine were assayed. The sera were analyzed for their ability to neutralize Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) strains.

>The trial participants' sera demonstrated a neutralizing capacity of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) strain equal to NVX-CoV2373, with a modest reduction in neutralizing capacity against the Beta (B.1.351) strain. These data support the development and production of a Beta (B.1.351) targeted vaccine, which also demonstrated to be efficient at protecting mice against Beta (B.1.351) and to induce a strong response in primates originally immunized with NVX-CoV2373. Furthermore, the data support that a booster vaccine containing a variant strain could both increase antibody levels as well as broaden coverage.

h1ss2oe,2021-06-14,"Summary

The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine1–3 has demonstrated clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, including against the B.1.351 variant that is partially resistant to neutralizing antibodies1. However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase 1/2 clinical trial2 against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1., and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers that were 5.0- and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 following vaccination. Median binding antibody titers were 2.9- and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition, and NK cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",2,0.044,0.027,0.929,0.4019

h1psiyn,2021-06-14,"At long last, the results from Novavax's second phase 3 trial - this time in the US and Mexico - arrive. Copied the relevant bits of the press release:

>GAITHERSBURG, Md., June 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), today announced that NVX-CoV2373, its recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall, and met the primary endpoint in its PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial. The study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the U.S. and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, with an emphasis on recruiting a representative population of communities and demographic groups most impacted by the disease.

>""Today, Novavax is one step closer to addressing the critical and persistent global public health need for additional COVID-19 vaccines. These clinical results reinforce that NVX-CoV2373 is extremely effective and offers complete protection against both moderate and severe COVID-19 infection,"" said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax. ""Novavax continues to work with a sense of urgency to complete our regulatory submissions and deliver this vaccine, built on a well understood and proven platform, to a world that is still in great need of vaccines.""

>The company intends to file for regulatory authorizations in the third quarter, upon completion of the final phases of process qualification and assay validation needed to meet chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) requirements. Upon regulatory approvals, Novavax remains on track to reach manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.

>""PREVENT-19 confirms that NVX-CoV2373 offers a reassuring tolerability and safety profile,"" said Gregory M. Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development, Novavax. ""These data show consistent, high levels of efficacy and reaffirm the ability of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 amid ongoing genetic evolution of the virus. Our vaccine will be a critical part of the solution to COVID-19 and we are grateful to the study participants and trial staff who made this study possible, as well as our supporters, including the U.S. Government.""

>**Results: Consistent, high efficacy among circulating variants**

>In the placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study randomized 2:1, **NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated overall efficacy of 90.4%** (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6), achieving its primary endpoint. Seventy-seven cases were observed: 63 in the placebo group and 14 in the vaccine group. **All cases observed in the vaccine group were mild as defined by the trial protocol.** Ten moderate cases and four severe cases were observed, all in the placebo group, yielding a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 87.0, 100) against moderate or severe disease.

>Efficacy endpoints were accrued from January 25 through April 30, 2021 — a time when the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, first identified in the U.K., became the predominant strain in the U.S. Other strains, including Variants of Interest (VoI) and Variants of Concern (VoC), were also on the rise during the PREVENT-19 endpoint accrual window. Click here for CDC definitions of variants.

>Sequence data are available for 54 of the 77 cases. PREVENT-19 met its key secondary endpoint, demonstrating 100% efficacy (95% CI: 80.8, 100) against variants not considered VoC/VoI. Of the sequenced cases, 35 (65%) were VoC, 9 (17%) were VoI, and 10 (19%) were other variants. **Against VoC/VoI, which represented 82% of the cases, vaccine efficacy was 93.2%** (95% CI: 83.9, 97.1), achieving a key exploratory endpoint of the study. Thirty-eight of the VoC/VoI cases were in the placebo group and 6 were in the vaccine group.

>NVX-CoV2373 also showed success among ""high-risk"" populations (defined as over age 65, under age 65 with certain comorbidities or having life circumstances with frequent COVID-19 exposure): vaccine efficacy was 91.0% (95% CI: 83.6, 95.0), with 62 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group and 13 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group.

>**Results: Reasserting a favorable safety profile**

>Preliminary safety data from PREVENT-19 showed the vaccine to be generally well-tolerated. Serious and severe adverse events were low in number and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. No single adverse event term was reported by more than 1% of participants. In assessing reactogenicity 7 days after Dose 1 and Dose 2, injection site pain and tenderness, generally mild to moderate in severity, were the most common local symptoms, lasting less than 3 days. Fatigue, headache and muscle pain were the most common systemic symptoms, lasting less than 2 days.

>**Study Endpoints**

>The primary endpoint for PREVENT-19 was the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline. The statistical success criterion included a lower bound of 95% CI >30%.

>Novavax expects to share further details of the PREVENT-19 trial results as additional data become available. Further analyses of the trial are ongoing and will be shared via preprint servers as well as submitted to peer-review journals for publication.

**Background**

The safety and immunogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines when administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccines has not yet been reported.

**Methods**

A sub-study on influenza vaccine co-administration was conducted as part of the phase 3 randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373. The first ~400 participants meeting main study entry criteria and with no contraindications to influenza vaccination were invited to join the sub-study. After randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive NVX-CoV2373 (n=217) or placebo (n=214), sub-study participants received an age-appropriate, licensed, open-label influenza vaccine with dose 1 of NVX-CoV2373. Reactogenicity was evaluated via electronic diary for 7 days post-vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), medically-attended AEs (MAAEs), and serious AEs (SAEs). Influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG assays were performed. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed. Comparisons were made between sub-study and main study participants.

**Findings**

Sub-study participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than main study participants. Reactogenicity events more common in the co-administration group included tenderness (70.1% vs 57.6%) or pain (39.7% vs 29.3%) at injection site, fatigue (27.7% vs 19.4%), and muscle pain (28.3% vs 21.4%). Rates of unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, and SAEs were low and balanced between the two groups. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response, while a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. Vaccine efficacy in the sub-study was 87.5% (95% CI: -0.2, 98.4) while efficacy in the main study was 89.8% (95% CI: 79.7, 95.5). 

**Interpretation**

This is the first study to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. The results suggest concomitant vaccination may be a viable immunisation strategy.

**Funding**

This study was funded by Novavax, Inc.",2,0.049,0.067,0.885,-0.5859

h1z13cz,2021-06-16,"I don’t think it’s necessarily politically motivated.  It’s been known for a long time that inactivated vaccines generally pretty decent humoral immunity, but not terribly good mucosal immunity.  This is why IPV very effectively prevents poliomyelitis (the virus needs to get into the blood to get to the CNS) but don’t stop transmission.

The exception that proves the rule is the HPV vaccine that uses virus-like particles, which generate a very strong antibody response that does provide mucosal immunity.  The VLP Novavax candidate operates on a similar principle and I expect it to provide robust mucosal immunity.

In general, expression-based approaches in which the recipient cells are made to express Viral antigens tend to produce very robust antiviral immune responses and usually there is some spill over to the mucosa. The mRNA vaccines are immunologically no different than any other expression-based approach, but they are fast to develop and we can select specific antigens.

I think the actual results that we are seeing speak for themselves. Sinovac Sinopharm products seem to provide very good protection against severe illness, but they don’t seem to provide terribly good protection against overall infection. As such, it will take very high population coverage of these to unload the healthcare system and effectively end the pandemic.  By contrast, expression based in viruslike particle approaches provide stronger mucosal immunity and so they require lower population coverage to end the pandemic.",7,0.161,0.084,0.754,0.9674

>Recently the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pervasive threat to public health so it is an emergency to vaccine development. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein plays a vital role in binds and fusion to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The multi-epitope peptide vaccines are capable of inducing the specific humoral or cellular immune responses. In this regard, the RBD and spike cleavage site is the most probable target for vaccine development to inducing binds and fusion inhibitors neutralizing antibodies. In the present study, several immunoinformatics tools are used for analyzing the spike (S) glycoprotein sequence including the prediction of the potential linear B-cell epitopes, B-cell multi-epitope design, secondary and tertiary structures, physicochemical properties, solubility, antigenicity, and allergenicity for the promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.",3,0.091,0.073,0.836,0.1779

Thrombo-embolic events with concurrent low platelets

""The overall incidence after first or unknown doses was 14.8 per million doses. Taking into account the different numbers of patients vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in different age groups, the data shows that there is a higher reported incidence rate in the younger adult age groups following the first dose compared to the older groups (20.2 per million doses in those aged 18-49 years compared to 10.7 per million doses in those aged 50 years and over). The MHRA advises that this evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the vaccine. There is now some evidence that the reported incidence rate is higher in females compared to men although this is not seen across all age groups and the difference remains small.'

h2vxbj5,2021-06-24,"> SARS-CoV-2 variants that attenuate antibody neutralization could jeopardize vaccine efficacy and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recently reported the protective activity of a single-dose intranasally-administered spike protein-based chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in animals, which has advanced to human trials. 

>Here, we assessed its durability, dose-response, and cross-protective activity in mice. A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced durably high neutralizing and Fc effector antibody responses in serum and S-specific IgG and IgA secreting long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. Protection against a historical SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed across a 100-fold vaccine dose range and over a 200-day period. 

>**At 6 weeks or 9 months after vaccination, serum antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 strains with B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 spike proteins and conferred almost complete protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after challenge**.  Thus, in mice, intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides durable protection against historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.

> A single-dose IN immunization promotes superior humoral immunity than IM immunization; (b) 100-fold 
 lower inoculating doses of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induce robust neutralizing antibody responses 
in mice; (c) IN but not IM immunization induces serum IgA responses and IgA-specific LLPCs  against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein; and (d) the humoral immunity induced by ChAd-SARS-CoV-
 is durable and rises over a six-month period after vaccination.  Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG1 titers after IN immunization also were higher  against all spike and RBD variants than after IM immunization

For reference: this is Bharat BioTechs/Washington Uni BBV154 vaccine. Very similar construct to AZ/ChadOx but with stablising mutation and delivered intranasally.   It has now completed phase 1 human trials,  (few days ago - results not yet publicized) with both nasal spray and nasal drops evaluated- trials moving to phase 2",10,0.04,0.026,0.934,0.4588

h2v4xp5,2021-06-24,"> Abstract

> The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India, displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages. Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across three centres in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (p=0.02). In vitro, the Delta variant shows 8 fold approximately reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were significantly lower in participants vaccinated with ChadOx-1 as compared to BNT162b2 (GMT 3372 versus 654, p<0001). These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity. Whilst severe disease in fully vaccinated HCW was rare, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need continue in the post-vaccination era.

> But Mehul Suthar, a viral immunologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, is concerned that vaccine-induced immunity will not be as durable as immunity from natural infection. Suthar says that he and his collaborators have found that antibody levels declined faster in those who were vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine than in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies are not the only determinant of immunity, he says, but the results worry him. “I’m a little concerned that the vaccines weren’t as robust in generating more durable antibody responses,” Suthar says. “When you factor in variants, to me it’s clear that we’re going to need a booster.”

But ultimately /u/TheChaosGrinder's response seems to be the correct one (but I'm not an immunologist so can't really judge, it does seem to be a consensus amongst level-headed people though).

I do wonder why the scientific literature does seem to spend so much time talking about antibodies as the be-all and end-all, and whether this is ""mis-selling"" what vaccine success actually looks like in the real world. i.e. a world with hundreds of thousands of mild breakthrough infections is a triumph, not something to panic about.",8,0.106,0.039,0.855,0.9544

h3c5ti3,2021-06-28,">	Background: Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation, however we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAd, Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT, Comirnaty, Pfizer) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here we report the immunogenicity of these schedules. 

>Methods: Com-COV (ISRCTN: 69254139, EudraCT: 2020-005085-33) is a participant-blind, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Adults ≥ 50 years, including those with well-controlled comorbidities, were randomised across eight groups to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT or BNT/ChAd, administered at 28- or 84-day intervals.

>The primary endpoint is geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG levels (ELISA) at one-month post boost between heterologous and homologous schedules given the same prime vaccine. We tested non-inferiority of GMR using a margin of 0.63. The primary analysis was on a per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were performed amongst participants receiving at least one dose of study vaccines.

>Findings: In February 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 with a 28-day prime-boost interval whose results are reported in this paper. Participant mean age was 57.8 years, 45.8% were female, and 25.3% from ethnic minorities.The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of day 28 post-boost SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12,906 ELU/ml) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1,392 ELU/ml) with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 9.2 (one-sided 97.5% CI: 7.5, ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we failed to show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, GMC 7,133 ELU/ml) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, GMC 14,080 ELU/ml) with a GMR of 0.51 (one-sided 97.5% CI: 0.43, ∞). Geometric mean of T cell response at 28 days post boost in the ChAd/BNT group was 185 SFC/10 6 PBMCs (spot forming cells/10 6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) compared to 50, 80 and 99 SFC/10 6 PBMCs for ChAd/ChAd, BNT/BNT, and BNT/ChAd, respectively. There were four serious adverse events across all groups, none of which were considered related to immunisation.

>Interpretation: Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the GMCs of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. These data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.",2,0.039,0.018,0.943,0.8225

h3bh56t,2021-06-28,"Dr Peter English, Retired Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, Former Editor of Vaccines in Practice, Immediate past Chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said:

“When the first Covid-19 vaccines became available, there was a lot of discussion about how we could use them most effectively. I have commented on this previously.2 3

“One of the particular issues was that the phase 3 trials had used particular prime-boost intervals; and some considered that those must be, somehow sacrosanct. That any variation from those intervals might render the vaccines ineffective.

“We know a great deal about how the immune system interacts with diseases, and have decades of research into how it interacts with vaccines. Concerns as above did not generally come from vaccinologists. We know that extending the prime-boost interval enhances the immune response. We can’t be certain how long this continues for; but it is one of the rules of thumb that applies to prime-boost vaccines that, while you risk reducing vaccine efficacy if you give booster doses sooner than recommended, you can extend the prime-boost interval almost indefinitely (certainly for at least a decade) without a reduction in the efficacy of the booster; and, certainly for a year or so, increasing the prime-boost interval enhances booster efficacy.

“With the human papillomavirus 2-dose vaccine regime, for example, if the second dose is given before the recommended 6-month interval, guidance recommends that an additional dose be given at least 6-months after the priming dose.4

“It was right, at the turn of the year, to make judgements based on this knowledge of vaccines.

“But it is always best to test ones assumptions, to ensure that they were correct.

“This paper does just that.

“It found that – entirely as expected – there was an increased antibody response if the second dose was delayed. The limitations of the trial (the time between the trial starting and publication) could mean that this could only be observed for up to about 45 weeks, but there is no reason to expect this improvement to fall away if and when the trial is extended for longer.

“There was limited data, so the authors were unable to comment on the effect of delaying the second dose on the T-cell response.

“The other question the authors sought to answer related to the effect of a second, later booster dose. As any vaccinologist would expect, a subsequent booster dose further enhanced the antibody responses; and here the authors had sufficient data to demonstrate also an increase in T-cell responses.

“This paper’s findings, therefore, are no surprise to vaccinologists. They confirm what we had predicted. But it remains very important to check that our predictions were correct, and this paper does just that.”",21,0.094,0.028,0.878,0.9842

>The trial will recruit approximately 2,250 participants across UK, South Africa, Brazil and Poland.

>AZD2816 will be administered to individuals who have previously been fully vaccinated with two doses of Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, at least three months after their last injection. In non-vaccinated individuals, AZD2816 will be given as two doses, four or twelve weeks apart, or given as a second dose following a first dose of Vaxzevria four weeks apart.

>AZD2816 has been designed using the same adenoviral vector platform as Vaxzevria, with minor genetic alterations to the spike protein based on the Beta (B.1.351, South African) variant.

>Sir Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “It is important we continue to stay ahead of genetically distinct variants of the coronavirus. AZD2816 should help broaden individuals immune response against emerging variants of concern. Initiating the Phase II/III trial for AZD2816 means we can be prepared should a variant vaccine be required in the future.”

h3bbi4j,2021-06-28,"There has been an answer on this from several previous studies 1) showing anti-chadox and anti-spike titres from both chadOx naive and prior chadOx vectored vaccine recipients, anti chadOx response is small whereas anti-spike titres are clearly magnified relatively 2) earlier preliminary data shared on ox/az used as booster, with unedited vector where a good response was noted as long as sufficient time had passed

again today another  study further confirmed that the same vector used in future -- (the vector replication is deficient so the body doesn't get a chance to catalogue and profile it that extensively)-  results in strong boost with little implied reduction in effectiveness. Not to say there's absolutely no reduction in effectiveness whatsoever, but clearly not enough to limit it's potential utility as a booster, if required. 

> University of Oxford researchers found that delaying a second jab up to 45 weeks after the first results in increased antibody levels – a key part of the body’s immune response – offering greater flexibility in vaccination schedules. A third dose six months after the second resulted in a further increase in antibody levels, they also found, mitigating scientists’ concerns that the design of the Oxford vaccine would limit repeated use

> Some 90 people in the trial received a third dose six months after their second and antibody levels were “significantly higher” following a third dose when compared with the response 28 days after a second dose.

Serum neutralisation and binding IgG/IgA after the first vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a marked drop in participants over 80 years old. 

Sera from participants above 80 showed significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. variants of concern as compared to wild type and were more likely to lack any neutralisation against VOC following the first dose. 

However, following the second dose, neutralisation against VOC was detectable regardless of age. Frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific B-memory cells was higher in elderly responders versus non-responders after first dose. 

Elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in somatic hypermutation of class switched cells. SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific T- cell IFNγ and IL-2 responses decreased with increasing age, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells.

>* Structure-based network analysis identifies mutation-constrained residues in SARS-CoV-2
* Highly networked residues are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses
* HLA stabilization defines highly networked epitopes with limited variation in VOCs
* Highly networked epitopes elicit CD8+ T cell reactivity in recovered individuals

>Summary

>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape convalescent and vaccine-induced antibody responses has renewed focus on the development of broadly protective T cell-based vaccines. Here we apply structure-based network analysis and assessments of HLA class I-peptide stability to define mutationally constrained CD8+ T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Highly networked residues are conserved temporally among circulating variants and across the Sarbecovirus subgenus, and disproportionately impair Spike pseudotyped lentivirus infectivity when mutated. Evaluation of HLA class I stabilizing activity for 18 globally prevalent alleles identifies CD8+ T cell epitopes within highly networked regions with limited mutational frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and deep-sequenced primary isolates. Moreover, these epitopes elicit demonstrable CD8+ T cell reactivity in convalescent individuals but reduced recognition in mRNA-based vaccine recipients. These data thereby elucidate key mutationally constrained regions and immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for a global T cell-based vaccine against emerging variants and sarbecoviruses.",3,0.007,0.037,0.956,-0.4588

I've quickly ran the relevant part of the text, via Google Translate, and corrected some translation issues. Considering Turkey had started using Sinovac first, most of the said group (50+ and HCWs) is fully vaccinated with Sinovac. So they are given an option to choose either a 3rd dose of Sinovac or Pfizer/BioNTech as a booster.

--- Google Translated from Turkish to English ---
In today's meeting, our Scientific Committee made an evaluation about the necessity of the 3rd dose of vaccines.

Accordingly, it has been decided that it would be beneficial for our citizens over 50 years of age and our healthcare professionals to receive their 3rd dose of vaccines, regardless of which vaccine it could be. Our citizens aged 50 and over who have been vaccinated for 2 doses, as well as our healthcare professionals, will be able to make an appointment for the 3rd dose vaccine with the vaccine they want, starting tomorrow. 
There is no restriction or priority with which vaccine type the dose is given. Our citizens and healthcare professionals can have the vaccine they want as the third dose, regardless of which vaccine they have had in the first two doses. The choice in this matter is yours.

>Offer of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines to adults aged under 40 years began

As mentioned above there is caveat that this includes mixed landscape of Alpha and Delta;  however given what we know about differentials of effectiveness between alpha and delta- (covered within this paper in seperate section) -- even if we assume landscape was entirely alpha this still insinuates higher one dose effectiveness against Delta of mRNA vaccines  in 'younger' groups than previously stated figures covering all ages.  intuitive- as we saw from trials covering adolescents effectiveness was higher-  but nice to have some additional real world evidence of this, especially for countries with younger populations (median age of the world ~31)",2,0.069,0.0,0.931,0.967

>Background: We report the clinical efficacy against COVID 19 infection of BBV152, a whole virion inactivated SARS CoV 2 vaccine formulated with a Toll like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel IMDG).

>Methods: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age 18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60 years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses for three consecutive manufacturing lots.

>Findings: Between November 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis, 130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0.77%) participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI: 65.2,86.4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of 93.4% (57.1,99.8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID 19 was 63.6% (29.0, 82.4). BBV152 conferred 65.2% (95% CI: 33.1, 83.0) protection against the SARS CoV 2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths were reported.

>Interpretation: BBV152 was immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that observed with other COVID-19 vaccines.",16,0.068,0.048,0.885,0.7665

Understanding human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines is of interest for a panoply of reasons. Here we examined vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, binding antibody, and neutralizing antibody responses to the 25 ug Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine over 7 months post-immunization, including multiple age groups, with a particular interest in assessing whether pre-existing crossreactive T cell memory impacts vaccine-generated immunity. Low dose (25 ug) mRNA-1273 elicited durable Spike binding antibodies comparable to that of convalescent COVID-19 cases. Vaccine-generated Spike memory CD4+ T cells 6 months post-boost were comparable in quantity and quality to COVID-19 cases, including the presence of TFH cells and IFNg-expressing cells. Spike CD8+ T cells were generated in 88% of subjects, with equivalent percentages of CD8+ T cell memory responders at 6 months post-boost compared to COVID-19 cases. Lastly, subjects with pre-existing crossreactive CD4+ T cell memory had increased CD4+ T cell and antibody responses to the vaccine, demonstrating a biological relevance of SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive CD4+ T cells.",5,0.06,0.012,0.928,0.802

I agree efficacy is high—64% is better than 0%. But this means that EITHER initial studies were wrong, OR that vaccine efficacy (with Pfizer particularly) drops off after some time period. Does that mean it'll keep dropping? Will it level out at 64%? Unclear—but the point is, we don't have enough data, and until we do, people should keep wearing masks and distancing even if they're vaccinated because we don't know how long the vaccine will continue to stop us from getting infected, even asymptomatically, and therefore spreading to other people.

Given that the majority of spreading happens from asymptomatic people, that's a non-trivial risk when vaccinated people live in communities with low vaccination rates, and can thus become spreaders and carriers if they aren't careful.

The effect of whether the participants put effort to prevent infection will affect both numbers in a similar fashion (number of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases). Also, the large enough data set is chosen to already ""average out"" this effect in the estimate of efficacy against symptomatic infection. Because N, for the number of asymptomatic+symptomatic cases, is larger, the statistics should be ""strong enough"" to average out those fluctuations in this setting. 

On the second remark: yes, symptomatic prevention is one big goal. But another one, I'd assume, is actually reaching herd immunity to prevent further mutations that leave us in square one.

I'm not saying either of us is definitively right. I'm just saying that the data seem to be indicating there's a chance of declining efficacy, and that people should take basic precautions until we know more. Heck, even Fauci said in late March that we wouldn't know for sure how well the vaccine works at blocking transmission until probably late summer (""We hope that within the next 5 or so months, we'll be able answer the very important question about whether vaccinated people get infected asymptomatically, and if they do, *do they transmit the infection to others*."")

The best way to determine this post-trials (and it's actually happening) is with trials in HCWs, like SIREN. Those are regularly tested and readouts will give a better idea of the efficacy against infection (with the problem that HCWs are more exposed to the virus, but they are rarely in the at-risk populations). 

>  But another one, I'd assume, is actually reaching herd immunity to prevent further mutations that leave us in square one. (

I think the impact of mutations is overstated. Yes, they need to be monitored (more importantly for treatments, like monoclonals, that can become ineffective). Yes, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually be able to evade vaccine immunity, but with some caveats, as I see it:

1. Partial evasion does not equal to a naive immune system, so there's no ""back to square one"". A partially trained immune system is able to cope much better than a naive one.  
2. There's the contribution of natural immunity to the mix (regardless of the politicized views around it, it is a fact)

____
All samples from infected and vaccinated persons showed less neutralizing activity against both the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants than against WA1/2020 (Figure 1). Among convalescent serum samples, the FRNT50 geometric mean titer (GMT) against B.1.617.1 was 79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 128), as compared with 514 (95% CI, 358 to 740) against WA1/2020 (five samples had undetectable activity against the B.1.617.1 variant); the GMT against B.1.617.2 was 207 (95% CI, 135 to 319), as compared with 504 (95% CI, 358 to 709) against WA1/2020 (one sample had undetectable activity against the B.1.617.2 variant). Among the mRNA-1273 samples, the GMT against B.1.617.1 was 190 (95% CI, 131 to 274), as compared with 1332 (95% CI, 905 to 1958) against WA1/2020; the GMT against B.1.617.2 was 350 (95% CI, 229 to 535), as compared with 1062 (95% CI, 773 to 1460) against WA1/2020. Among the BNT162b2 vaccine serum samples, the GMT against B.1.617.1 was 164 (95% CI, 104 to 258), as compared with 1176 (95% CI, 759 to 1824) against WA1/2020; the GMT against B.1.617.2 was 235 (95% CI, 164 to 338), as compared with 776 (95% CI, 571 to 1056) against WA1/2020. Among the three sample groups, the GMTs against the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants were significantly lower than those against the WA1/2020 strain.  
  
Our results show that the B.1.617.1 variant was 6.8 times less susceptible, and the B.1.617.2 variant was 2.9 times less susceptible, to neutralization by serum from persons who had recovered from Covid-19 and from vaccinated persons than was the WA1/2020 variant. Despite this finding, a majority of the convalescent serum samples (79% [19 of 24 samples] against B.1.617.1 and 96% [23 of 24 samples] against B.1.617.2) and all serum samples from vaccinated persons still had detectable neutralizing activity above the threshold of detection against both variants through 3 months after infection or after the second dose of vaccine. **Thus, protective immunity conferred by the mRNA vaccines is most likely retained against the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants.**",3,0.014,0.019,0.967,-0.2315

>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern. The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine was reported to have an efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 due to infection with ‘wild-type’ variants in a randomized clinical trial. Here, we assess the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, specifically B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta), in Qatar, a population that comprises mainly working-age adults, using a matched test-negative, case-control study design. We show that vaccine effectiveness was negligible for 2 weeks after the first dose, but increased rapidly in the third and fourth weeks immediately before administration of a second dose. Effectiveness against B.1.1.7 infection was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.7–91.5%) ≥14 days after the first dose but before the second dose, and was 100% (95% CI: 91.8–100.0%) ≥14 days after the second dose. Analogous effectiveness against B.1.351 infection was 61.3% after the first dose (95% CI: 56.5–65.5%) and 96.4% after the second dose (95% CI: 91.9–98.7%). Effectiveness against any severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 disease due to any SARS-CoV-2 infection (predominantly B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) was 81.6% (95% CI: 71.0–88.8%) and 95.7% (95% CI: 73.4–99.9%) after the first and second dose, respectively.

Three months after the first injection, humoral and cellular memory responses were dramatically impaired in the 54 COVID-19-naive older compared to the 121 COVID 19 naive younger adults. Notably, older participants' neutralizing antibodies, detected in 76.5% (versus 100% in young adults, P < 0.0001), were ten times lower than the younger's antibody titers (P < 0.0001). Antibody and T cell responses were greater among the 52 COVID 19-recovered than among the 54 COVID-19-naive older adults (P < 0.0001). Our study shows that 2 doses of BNT162b2 does not guarantee long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the older. An additional dose should be considered to boost their specific memory response.

Machine translation (DeepL):

> The Finlay Vaccine Institute officially updated on 8 July the results of the interim clinical efficacy analysis of the heterologous schedule of SOBERANA02 doses and a booster dose of SOBERANA-Plus. The final results of the clinical efficacy of the two-dose schedule of SOBERANA02 were also reported.

>SOBERANA02 is an innovative vaccine candidate based on the protein subunit vaccine platform. It is derived from the chemical conjugation of the recombinant RBD protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein to tetanus toxoid. It successfully completed Phase I and II clinical trials; demonstrating safety and immunogenicity. In these studies, administration of a booster dose of the SOBERANA-Plus candidate was shown to significantly increase the neutralising antibody response.

>The Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted from March to June this year, in a complex epidemiological context of circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus variants. Ministry of Public Health sources confirmed the predominance of the Beta strain (isolated in South Africa) in more than 74% of the strains sequenced in Havana during the period in which the research was carried out.  

>The research was conducted in 8 municipalities in Havana and included a sample of 44,010 subjects, randomly assigned to three treatment groups: 1) a placebo group; 2) a group receiving the homologous schedule with two doses of the candidate vaccine SOBERANA02 at 28-day intervals; and 3) a group receiving the heterologous schedule with two doses of the candidate vaccine SOBERANA02 and a booster dose of the candidate vaccine SOBERANA-Plus at 28-day intervals.

>The implementation of the study was satisfactory, with treatment coverage above 97% for the second and third doses. The study was organised with the support of the primary and secondary care system of Public Health, and the support of the University of Havana, the CUJAE and the Medical University played a decisive role. 

>Summary of the interim analysis of the efficacy of the heterologous scheme two doses of the vaccine candidate SOBERANA02 and a booster dose with the vaccine candidate SOBERANA-Plus

>Efficacy on symptomatic disease (considered the primary endpoint of the study) was estimated at 91.2% (95% CI 77.9; 96.5), based on the completion of the number of cases required for the first interim analysis (56 symptomatic cases).

>Efficacy in preventing death and severe systemic disease was significantly higher; 100% prevention was achieved. No deaths were reported in the study group vs. 3 in the placebo group. There was also a 75.7% (95% CI 60.7; 85%) efficacy on infection, with 21 PCR-positive cases detected in the study group and 78 in the placebo group.

>Summary of the final analysis of the efficacy of the homologous two-dose schedule of the candidate vaccine SOBERANA02

>In the final analysis the efficacy on symptomatic disease for the two-dose schedule increases from 62% reported in the interim analysis to 65.6% (95% CI 52.6; 75).

>Additionally, the effect on severe systemic disease and death is included in this analysis, with 62.5% and 61% respectively (CI not estimable due to the small number of cases).   

>In all evaluations, the safety of the vaccine candidates was verified, with no more than 0.5% adverse event rates related to the investigational product.

>The reliability of these results was endorsed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee that conducted the interim analyses and the final second-dose efficacy evaluation. This is a committee external to the sponsor, consisting of clinical, epidemiological and statistical experts, which was constituted since the Phase I clinical trial and has been responsible for issuing all partial safety and immunogenicity reports for the phase changes of the clinical development of this vaccine candidate.

>In terms of implementation, high standards of compliance with Good Clinical Practice are achieved, supported by: a) conduct by the ""Pedro Kourí"" Institute of Tropical Medicine; b) a systematic monitoring strategy by the National Clinical Trials Coordinating Centre (CENCEC); c) computerisation of all trial data, accessible from the GEOCUBA and DATYS platforms; d) coordination of all trial processes through the Provincial Health Directorate and the Provincial Centre of Hygiene and Epidemiology of Havana; e) external evaluation of immunological variables; f) management of all trial processes from an Integral Coordinating Centre.

>Overall, the results achieved for the prevention of symptomatic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 are higher than the 50% established by regulatory agencies and higher than the 60% hypothesised for this Phase 3 clinical trial. 415 days after the start of the project to develop this vaccine candidate, this is an extraordinary result of Cuban science, which has been possible thanks to the scientific and technical level of our researchers, the collaboration between different national and international scientific institutions, the professionalism of the clinical research teams, the confidence of the thousands of volunteers who have participated in the clinical trials and the priority given by the Government. Today, we are closer to achieving the dream of SOBERANA02 and SOBERANA-Plus becoming VACCINE and saving thousands of lives in Cuba and the world. Cuban science will not rest until the entire population is vaccinated against COVID-19.",6,0.062,0.03,0.908,0.9748

h4s6up6,2021-07-11,"We argue that alternative COVID-19 vaccine dosing regimens could potentially dramatically accelerate global COVID-19 vaccination and reduce mortality, and that the costs of testing these regimens are dwarfed by their potential benefits. We first use the high correlation between neutralizing antibody response and efficacy against disease (Khoury et. al. 2021) to show that half or even quarter doses of some vaccines generate immune responses associated with high vaccine efficacy. We then use an SEIR model to estimate that under these efficacy levels, doubling or quadrupling the rate of vaccination by using fractional doses would dramatically reduce infections and mortality. Since the correlation between immune response and efficacy may not be fully predictive of efficacy with fractional doses, we then use the SEIR model to show that fractional dosing would substantially reduce infections and mortality over a wide range of plausible efficacy levels. Further immunogenicity studies for a range of vaccine and dose combinations could deliver outcomes in weeks and could be conducted with a few hundred healthy volunteers. National regulatory authorities could also decide to test efficacy of fractional dosing in the context of vaccination campaigns based on existing immune response data, as some did for delayed second doses. If efficacy turned out to be high, the approach could be implemented broadly, while if it turned out to be low, downside risk could be limited by administering full doses to those who had received fractional doses. The SEIR model also suggests that delaying second vaccine doses will likely have substantial mortality benefits for multiple, but not all, vaccine-variant combinations, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance. Finally, we find that for countries choosing between approved but lower efficacy vaccines available immediately and waiting for mRNA vaccines, using immediately available vaccines typically reduces mortality.",1,0.061,0.039,0.9,0.765

**Objective** To determine whether adverse effects caused by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine are associated with the magnitude of vaccine-induced antibody levels.  
  
**Design** Single center, prospective, observational cohort study.  
  
**Setting** Participants worked at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and were seen monthly at the Naval Medical Research Center Clinical Trials Center.  
  
**Participants** Generally healthy adults that were not severely immunocompromised, had no history of COVID-19, and were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prior to vaccination.  
  
**Measures** Severity of vaccine-associated symptoms was obtained through participant completed questionnaires. Testing for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain was conducted using microsphere-based multiplex immunoassays.  
  
**Results** 206 participants were evaluated (69.4% female, median age 41.5 years old). We found no correlation between vaccine-associated symptom severity scores and vaccine-induced antibody titers one month after vaccination. We also observed that 1) post-vaccination symptoms were inversely correlated with age and weight and more common in women, 2) systemic symptoms were more frequent after the second vaccination, 3) high symptom scores after first vaccination were predictive of high symptom scores after second vaccination, and 4) older age was associated with lower titers.  
  
**Limitations** Study only observes antibody responses and consists of healthy participants.  
  
**Conclusions** Lack of post-vaccination symptoms following receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine does not equate to lack of vaccine-induced antibodies one month after vaccination. This study also suggests that it may be possible to design future mRNA vaccines that confer robust antibody responses with lower frequencies of vaccine-associated symptoms.",7,0.059,0.053,0.888,0.3903

Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titers of anti-spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical significance.

>We found that severe COVID-19 infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully-vaccinated individuals with multiple comorbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of comorbidities and immunosuppression compared to previously reported non-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further characterization of this vulnerable population may help to develop guidance to augment their protection, either by continued social-distancing, or by additional active or passive vaccinations.",23,0.041,0.12,0.839,-0.956
h58v57c,2021-07-14,"I don’t understand why papers never report basic information like subject ages. It’s very important for our understanding of vaccine efficacy, and it would take them almost no extra effort to do it.

They do say the median age was 71, but the range is 22 to 98, and I can’t find any indication of how age affected disease severity or survival.",57,0.051,0.052,0.897,-0.0147

>**Background**

>Emerging evidence shows the substantial real-world impact of authorised vaccines against COVID-19 and provides insight into the potential role of vaccines in curbing the pandemic. However, there remains uncertainty about the efficacy of vaccines against different variants of the virus. Here we assessed efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) against lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Brazil from June 2020 until early 2021.

>**Methods**

>Participants aged 18 and above were enrolled into a randomised phase 3 trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or control (1st dose: Men ACWY vaccine, 2nd dose: normal saline). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing was performed if participants developed symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, fever >37.8°C, ageusia, anosmia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2, sequenced, and viral load determined. For those samples where a genotype could not be ascertained from sequencing, allele specific PCR was performed. The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were unblinded after the vaccine was authorised for use, and the control participants offered vaccination. Infections occurring after unblinding were excluded from analysis. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 100% x (1 – relative risk (RR)), where RR was estimated from a robust Poisson model. The trial is registered at ISRCTN89951424.

>**Findings**

>9433 participants were eligible for inclusion in the pre-specified primary efficacy population, having reached more than 14 days after a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, of whom 307 were NAAT+, in this post-hoc analysis. From June 2020 to February 2021, the two most frequently identified lineages were P.2 (N=153) and B.1.1.28 (N=49). P.1 emerged during the study (N=18) but became dominant only after study unblinding. Viral loads were highest amongst those with P.1 infection. Vaccine efficacy (VE) for B.1.1.33 (88.2%, 95%CI 5, 99), B.1.1.28 (73%, 95% CI, 46, 86), P.2 (69% 95% CI, 55, 78) and P.1 (64%, 95% CI, -2, 87) was estimated. In participants who had received two doses of vaccine, one COVID-19 hospitalisation occurred in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 18 in the control group, with VE against hospitalisation 95% (95% CI 61, 99). There were 2 COVID-19 deaths in the control group and none in the vaccine group.

>**Interpretation**

>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 provides high efficacy against hospitalisation, severe disease and death from COVID-19 in Brazil and there is strong evidence of protection being maintained against P.2, despite the presence of the spike protein mutation E484K. Real world effectiveness studies are ongoing in Brazil to further establish protection against P.1 and other emerging variants.",18,0.028,0.03,0.942,-0.4497
