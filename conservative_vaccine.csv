This is not exactly a new technology, the ability to make this type of vaccine has been around for a couple of decades. This would be the first to actually make it to market though. There has been no demand for a new vaccine if the old ones work.

Long explanation, vaccines in current use generally fall into one of 2 categories “live attenuated” or “killed”. Live attenuated are just straight up the virus that have been chemically weakened in some way. Killed vaccines are essentially the virus chopped up and then injected. Most of the problems with vaccinations come from either the virus repairing itself and causing the infection, or a protein from the virus being similar to a naturally occurring human protein. This can cause an auto-immune reaction to the natural human protein as well as to the virus. The moderna vaccine Only contains a particular part of the virus called mRNA. mRNA can not convert to DNA and cause an infection. No known virus is capable of this. The vaccine contains no viral proteins, so causing an autoimmune reaction to a similar protein can not happen.

This isn’t to say the vaccine will have no adverse effects. But the effects that might be have been due to past vaccinations (such as guillian-barre) should not be possible.",1,0.065,0.097,0.837,-0.9045

g2p8euj,2020-08-24,"Title is inaccurate.  They are injecting genetic material to hijack your body's machinery to produce antibodies, but the goal is not to change your genetic code.

How it IS supposed to work is that the genetic fragment will enter the cell, and will float around building proteins that are a small fragment of a covid virus.  The body will then detect those fragments and trigger an immune response.   After a short while the inserted genes break down because they aren't protected from degradation and your body isn't rebuilding them as it does with your own RNA.

I can't speak to the dangers of gene jumping, this isn't my field...but modifying your base genetic code is absolutely not a stated goal.

Also:  You absolutely should be skeptical about rapidly developed experimental vaccines.  If you are a healthy 20 year-old a wait and see approach is (IMHO) absolutely the way to go.  If, on the other hand, you are an 80-year old with lung problems, like a couple of my close relatives, the math on the risk of the vaccine is far different and you should probably be first in line.

However i see the issues with the WHO and their handling of the coronavirus in regards to China and think politically we should be VERY weary of what we do surrounding that fact. Whatever we decide will have large implications toward the future of our country. Personally, id like to work with the countries we trust and exclude the ones we dont (China, potentially Russia, also smaller less powerful enemies like North Korea etc.) 

At this point, if we truly believe we are really really close to a vaccine as Trump has explained, i see no reason to work with the WHO except to try and repair a broken bond.

Politics and Science should never mix in an ideal world. But our world is never an ideal one. At this point, im not totally sure what the right move is.

Politics are a team sport but instead we play on our own team and rash talk the other side to beat them. I wish it wasn’t this way.

It’s going to be the same scientist and doctors figuring out this virus and when they’re ready with a vaccine than it’ll be time to get back to normality.

If people are concerned that the development skipped stages in testing, that is reasonable, but as long developers don't take shortcuts then there shouldn't be any concerns. Trying to ""rush"" a vaccine isn't possible, so there was an outcry for that.  I don't know if that actually happened or if people just claimed that was going to happen.

Trump was denying the severity of the virus in January,, which, in hindsight, is reasonable for people to criticize.  I think it's fair to criticize that we disbanded the pandemic response team, too.  The WHO announced the first case in January and the US formed the response team later that month.  We saw our [first death](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/DOD-Response-Timeline/) from the vaccine on February 6.  There are a number of quotes from the president downplaying the severity of the crisis during the earlier days of the pandemic  (""when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away,"" for example), so it's easy to see those and criticize him for not doing enough, but people should also pay attention more to government action and not to what the potus actually says.

I agree that we need to continue to work together across the aisle to fight the virus for now.

Likewise, we need to balance the risk and the reward as is always the case in clinical trials. There is a reason a phase 4 exists, the implication that you should never just assume that the product is completely safe. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, many people have stated many times that they are looking at this standard of the benefit outweighing the risk to it before it is released on a wide scale.

The more deadly/severe side effects SARS-CoV-2 is, the lower this threshold is. On the contrary, the more side effects or the less efficacy of the vaccine, the higher risk this threshold becomes.

(I’m a traditional progressive—spend money if you need to, but make it fucking count—so even though I’m socially not aligned with this sub, I am fiscally.)

We know that Donald Trump lies or stretches hyperbole so far that we can’t accept his words at face value. Sometimes he says something and everyone surrounding him contradicts it. That is a manipulation of truth, so we can’t always trust those words. Regarding this specifically, we know it takes a long time to do clinical trials, especially when the virus can affect people for a long time like COVID sometimes does. We’re learning more every day, and hearing that we have a vaccine that’s almost ready means we have a vaccine that we don’t know the side effects to. It’s like the flu shot, some people feel like crap for a day or two. Or it could be like an indexed ruin pill that could literally kill 1 in 14000 people—and if we give this to everyone, then people who already had it and didn’t know they have antibodies could die when they didn’t need to.

I know that some of it sounds far-fetched, but the big thing is that it’s *within the realm of possibility.* just like with law, when we talk about medicine it’s best to know *beyond a reasonable doubt* before taking action. I apply this lens to news from the left and from the right, because we have to now ask ourselves “when is someone I trust lying to me like everyone else? What if I’ve been lied to and the other side is the one telling the truth?” (Of course in reality they both lie when it’s convenient, making it harder to know.)

Yet on subjects like Climate Change you are way less than ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" and we're supposed to tank economies and spend trillions on it according to progressives. Why is medicine held to a threshold of that level when historically it never has?

I think it's a stretch to claim ""Trump lies"". He talks a lot more, and uses a lot of hyperbole (often in humor). But to pretend as if Trump lies more than say Biden, or Pelosi is just plain false. That's just your confirmation bias, as in you don't see the news of them lying their asses off (literally lying), while you also project intentions onto Trump in order to make it appear as if he is lying all the time.

In this case Trump is being optimistic to help the country be optimistic, as in it is important for the countries long term health for people to have hope. That doesn't mean Trump is lying nor does it mean he's exaggerating. It does mean he's being optimistic for the sake of the country and the people he leads.

If scientists are literally saying, ""we don't stand behind this vaccine at all and Trump is forcing us to release this"" I would agree there is danger. I think it's unfair to compare this to other clinical trials as this has an entire nation of resources supporting it and a very high public platform in which it will be scrutinized on. As in more resources, more interest, and more dedication typically results in a faster turn around than the average scenario.

I think it is more likely the vaccine will fail before leaving clinical trials. As it would be a phenomenal break through to create a Coronavirus vaccine.

>But yes, it’s not unreasonable to be concerned that some checks in place could be ignored or skipped for expediency, and that could be very dangerous on a grand scale.

That isn't what they are saying. They are opposing it purely based on political opposition. To what end?

I also wasn’t commenting on the article directly, but upon the more down-to-earth problems people have. 

I appreciate your well-thought out reply. Though I’m not sure why climate change (which this wasn’t about) would collapse the economy. In my daily job, I have to look for new ways to do the same things we’ve always done, and I support the DoD. Sometimes that means completely eliminating something over time to be replaced with something else. Unfortunately, as labor is now a commodity (not saying I like that, but that is the reality of hourly work), that means a new system has to be created. But there’s a lot of money in building infrastructure, and a lot of money in solar and wind. I’m also unsure why you say we’re not at that level of scrutiny with climate change.

I’d worry that his optimism in this case is giving people a dose of false hope at the best, and delaying Congress from acting on more relief at the worst—provided he’s taken seriously.

Thank you for understanding the crux of my argument though, that if the scientists aren’t fully behind the vaccine then we shouldn’t accept it just to meet a deadline.

There has been a huge push going on near 15 years that dramatic and radical changes need to be made to fight climate change. This has been pushed without clearly science supporting it. We have been told we ""can't wait"" and it must be done now. This has been a left political advocacy for many years. 

So my comment to you, was why this must have absolute certainty when other public policy measures being asserted from the left do not. I would say even with your proposed death tolls from a poorly released vaccine it would still be less impact than the Climate Change advocacy.

>I’d worry that his optimism in this case is giving people a dose of false hope at the best

There is no such thing as a false hope. It is just hope. Hope drives people, allows people to move on when they otherwise would not, and keeps a people strong. If you have no hope you have no future.

>Thank you for understanding the crux of my argument though, that if the scientists aren’t fully behind the vaccine then we shouldn’t accept it just to meet a deadline.

If scientists don't support their own product, yeah I wouldn't allow any of my family to use such a vaccine.

>Trump is a politician now, and he will do things to check them off as a “promise made, promise kept” because it looks good before election, not because it was done right.

That is the nature of politicians. Trump is also not a micromanager. While he is known to lay the foundation of what he wants his administration to accomplish, he allows the people to do their work. The CDC has never once stated Trump overruled them or forced them to do something they didn't agree with. I think it's a bit misrepresentation to project such intentions onto him when we have clear evidence from this year alone that this isn't how Trump acts. He also has a thousand leaks within his government, he was attempting to ""force"" a vaccine to come out and the scientists are telling him ""no"" we will 100% hear about it. Though hopefully we will get actual sources and not ""anonymous"" bullshit.

No point in releasing a drug that has a 5% chance of brain hemorrhage when the pill is just supposed to be a cough suppressant. Vaccines are unique in that even risks that would otherwise make the drug unmarketable end up being acceptable because the chance of eradicating, say, malaria, will shift that risk tolerance.

This is exactly why fast-tracking a covid vaccine is completely absurd. The disease were fighting is not severe enough to justify the potential adverse effects, and the speed of development and skipping of several phases of trials means we may never know what those effects are until the majority of humans on earth have received it.

The whole need for studies is due to the uncertainty of effectiveness of a recombinant vaccine.  Live vaccines are effective and are the oldest kind of vaccine around.  The problem is they present a risk of someone actively developing the disease you're trying to prevent. We could have had a live one by now for the young, hale, and healthy, while simultaneously working on a less risky to vulnerable populations recombinant one.  While live vaccines run a risk of killing people with compromised immune systems, recombinant ones don't work as well for those people as well as ""normal"" baseline pop. because they have less immune system to latch onto the vaccine with.  It's the reason why elderly people get bigger doses of flu vaccine etc vs the standard dose.  

Also no vaccine or disease exposure confers immunity forever. It's why you get boosters.  Properly administered Hep A and Hep B is good for about 7 years and those are stable viruses that don't mutate much.

Of course the implication is that any average American listening to their BS will the very last person. What MSM (and Redfield) omit is that the vaccine will be distributed in phases and by the end of the process the average person's grandparents, their cousin with asthma, their kids and their teachers, their grocery bagger, their niece who's an EMT will all have been inoculated.

What MSM left out: 

The draft of the MAP committee plan on how a limited supply of vaccine would be allocated lays out 4 phases of vaccination. Multiple drug companies have assured us vaccines will be available for use by the people in Phase 1 well before the end of this year. Some of the MAP discussion is pure SJW BS but their [draft](https://www.nap.edu/read/25914/chapter/4#57) includes the highest risk individuals in Phase 1 with the highest priority and at the head of the line to receive vaccinations as soon as they are cleared for use. What Redfield was referring to were Phase 4 individuals who by definition are at little risk. They will be at the tail of the line and may have to wait as long as he suggested but the vast majority of people at risk will have access well before.

**Phase 1**a: High Risk workers in Health Care facilities and First responders

b: People of all ages with serious underlying conditions and the elderly in congregate or overcrowded settings

**Phase 2**: Critical essential workers including teachers and school staff, bus drivers, the elderly not included in Phase 1, people with moderately serious underlying conditions, people in homeless shelters and prisons.

Per Fauci (on a good day) the drug companies and even Redfield,  at the very least the first phase will begin in that time frame. Vaccine will be available anyone classified as a  high risk worker in a health care facility or First Responder, then people of all ages with serious underlying conditions and the elderly in congregate or overcrowded settings. After that availability of the vaccine expands to 2 more tiers of people at increased risk of exposure or bad outcome, then in the 4th phase, the general public i.e. people with no extra risk of exposure and in good health get access. Makes sense, right?

What is happening though, is the D's and media are glomming onto how long it will take to get to Phase 4 where anyone who wants the vaccine can get it. It's deceptive: by Phase 4 everyone with any increased risk factors  (health, exposure, critical nature of job) will have already had access to the vaccine. Your kids, their teacher, the pharmacy tech, the grocery bagger at the supermarket, the bus driver, all will already have had access.  If you fall into the last tier, the odds of exposure or that you would become seriously ill are low, and the odds of dying are close to insignificant.

Once again to be clear. Many republicans are anti the govt forcing them to do things like wear a mask or take a vaccine. It would be applauded by republican voters if their governor were to be wary, and prudently get a second opinion on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine that, by most measures, is rushed, and ahead of the typical timeline for adminstration to the people.

But in your comment you are upset that this democrat governor is wanting to get essentially a second opinion.

gbqnhfp,2020-11-09," Here's how the Washington Post reported on this earlier in the year:

> The contract is the largest yet under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, and will start with 100 million doses.

...

> Through Operation Warp Speed, an effort to fast-track the development of coronavirus countermeasures, the U.S. is investing billions of dollars to reduce the financial risk to companies of scaling up vaccine production before the products are proved to be safe and effective. Typically, companies wait for data before initiating large-scale manufacturing, but because of the urgent global need, they are making doses so that they can be ready the day they are shown effective.

> The Pfizer contract is the fifth large vaccine investment by the U.S. government to help support the research and development or pre-purchase of experimental vaccines, which have also gone to Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax. The government is also working to increase the supply of other essential components, such as glass vials and syringes, and to ramp up vaccine manufacturing capabilities more broadly.

> Pfizer plans to have 100 million doses of a vaccine available by the end of the year and produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, suggesting that the U.S. contract could tie up much of the supply the company plans to manufacture in the near future.

And here is the New York Times, earlier this year:

> The contract is part of what the White House calls the Warp Speed project, an effort to drastically shorten the time it would take to manufacture and distribute a working vaccine. So far, the United States has put money into more than a half dozen efforts, hoping to build manufacturing ability for an eventual breakthrough.

...

> Under the arrangement, the federal government would obtain that first batch for $1.95 billion, or about $20 a dose, with the rights to acquire up to 500 million more, or 600 million total. Americans would receive the vaccine for free. Before it could be distributed, it would need emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration. But the U.S. government does not pay the nearly $2 billion until the drug is approved and the first 100 million doses are delivered.

...

> “Pfizer is a company that has a lot of expertise in making vaccines,” he said. “They knew that any negotiation with the government could have delayed the start” of trials, which he said the company knew how to set up rapidly.

> He added that the $1.95 billion agreement was a way to guarantee a market for the vaccine at the end of production, since prominent drugmakers have historically been hesitant to spend on infectious disease outbreaks.

> “Advance purchase agreements have been one way we’ve been able to acquire vaccines and countermeasures against certain threats that pharmaceutical companies have traditionally stayed away from,” he said.",5,0.119,0.025,0.855,0.9938

> Pfizer Inc.

Under the agreement, the U.S. government will receive 100 million doses of BNT162, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, after Pfizer successfully manufactures and obtains approval or emergency use authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",3,0.139,0.025,0.836,0.9633

Phase 1: here is context for the very start, where they once again state their intended target is 30000 participants and they plan on producing 100 million doses by the end of 2020. So, between phase 2 and 3 they reached and exceeded their goals but are continuing until they reach 168 confirmed cases to then submit the vaccine to the FDA to get approval in order to reach that planned 100 million doses. “If the Phase 2/3 trial is successful, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be ready to seek Emergency Use Authorization or some form of regulatory approval as early as October 2020.”  So, we got this news early November, just a little behind their projection back in July, which seems reasonable.

> In addition, Bourla noted that an independent data monitoring committee had yet to conduct its interim review of whether the vaccine is safe. **The planned point for the interim review is when 32 study participants were infected with symptomatic COVID-19. “We don’t have the 32 events right now,” Bourla said.** He also said it was “extremely unlikely” that any efficacy data would be publicized before November 3—not just to avoid politics, but because it would take at least a week to fully analyze the data.

> Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the execution of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program goal to begin delivering 300 million doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 in 2021. Under the agreement, the U.S. government will receive 100 million doses of BNT162, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, after Pfizer successfully manufactures and obtains approval or emergency use authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

From other reporting, WaPo; ""Pfizer, BioNTech reach $1.95 billion covid-19 vaccine deal with U.S. government""

> The contract is the largest yet under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, and will start with 100 million doses.

...

> Through Operation Warp Speed, an effort to fast-track the development of coronavirus countermeasures, the U.S. is investing billions of dollars to reduce the financial risk to companies of scaling up vaccine production before the products are proved to be safe and effective. Typically, companies wait for data before initiating large-scale manufacturing, but because of the urgent global need, they are making doses so that they can be ready the day they are shown effective.

> The Pfizer contract is the fifth large vaccine investment by the U.S. government to help support the research and development or pre-purchase of experimental vaccines, which have also gone to Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax. The government is also working to increase the supply of other essential components, such as glass vials and syringes, and to ramp up vaccine manufacturing capabilities more broadly.

> Pfizer plans to have 100 million doses of a vaccine available by the end of the year and produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, suggesting that the U.S. contract could tie up much of the supply the company plans to manufacture in the near future.

And here is the New York Times, earlier this year:

> The contract is part of what the White House calls the Warp Speed project, an effort to drastically shorten the time it would take to manufacture and distribute a working vaccine. So far, the United States has put money into more than a half dozen efforts, hoping to build manufacturing ability for an eventual breakthrough.

...

> Under the arrangement, the federal government would obtain that first batch for $1.95 billion, or about $20 a dose, with the rights to acquire up to 500 million more, or 600 million total. Americans would receive the vaccine for free. Before it could be distributed, it would need emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration. But the U.S. government does not pay the nearly $2 billion until the drug is approved and the first 100 million doses are delivered.

...

> “Pfizer is a company that has a lot of expertise in making vaccines,” he said. “They knew that any negotiation with the government could have delayed the start” of trials, which he said the company knew how to set up rapidly.

> He added that the $1.95 billion agreement was a way to guarantee a market for the vaccine at the end of production, since prominent drugmakers have historically been hesitant to spend on infectious disease outbreaks.

> “Advance purchase agreements have been one way we’ve been able to acquire vaccines and countermeasures against certain threats that pharmaceutical companies have traditionally stayed away from,” he said.

THE FACTS: Pfizer notably did not accept government money to develop, test or expand manufacturing capacity under Trump’s Operation Warp Speed initiative to quickly find a vaccine and treatments for the disease sweeping the country.

In fact, Pfizer partnered with the vaccine’s original developer, Germany’s BioNTech, in March and the following month announced the first human study in Germany. The White House announced Operation Warp Speed in May.

Pfizer opted not to join Operation Warp Speed initially but is following the same general requirements for the vaccine’s development as competitors who received government research money.

Hear me out.

One of those ""other countries"" of course is China. Well there's a sticky wicket for you. Share the vaccine with China? Before all Americans have had a chance? I can already see the Blue Tribe and Red Tribe lining up to oppose each other over that question, so let's take the issue away and prevent the debate in the first place.

How? Let's do it. Let's share the vaccine with China, with these conditions:

1) we give China their first batch of doses for free

2) we deliver the real thing, high quality, no funny business

3) we deliver it on two fully loaded air force C-5's

4) we deliver it to the Beijing's shiny new airport

5) we deliver it in broad daylight (this isn't pallets of cash after all)

6) president Xi comes personally to receive it

7) president Xi shakes hands with the person delivering it

That's all. The CCP leader doesn't even have to say ""谢谢"" (thank you) although that would be nice. Just a handshake, maybe a Winnie-the-Pooh smile, easy peasy 柠檬 squeezy. Paints a beautiful picture, doesn't it? I'm excited just thinking about it.

I don't care what norms this breaks. Admiral Fallon peacefully visited Harbin and the world didn't end. No reason we can't deliver some medicine today. This is absolutely do-able.

As to who shakes Xi's hand? I'm not concerned. Trump? Sure, whatever. Biden? Why not. Harris? Sounds fun. Yang? Great. Pompeo? Maybe not. Personally my favorite option is Feinstein (with her Chinese-spy driver), but only if we intend to leave her behind, in China, for good. Call it a parting gift. 🎁

What an absolutely perfect picture this paints. Win-win-win. China gets a bunch of vaccine for free, and the USA gets this stunt.

Instead it stores information about the disease in immune memory B cells which produce antibodies again after it is encountered again.  Also what they don't mention is T cells do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to fighting viruses, not antibodies.  And there is plenty of evidence of long term T cell response for COVID.  Additionally there are even studies that show that many of us already have some T cell immunity to COVID acquired from infections from other coronaviruses.

In relation to vaccine development under Star Wars 69: operation warp speed, from wikipedia:
""There is concern that the name and intended shortened timeline of Operation Warp Speed could encourage the antivaccine movement, with one expert stating: ""I don’t see a path by which you can collect enough efficacy and safety data by the end of the year.""[3] Failure of the public to have confidence in a new vaccine and refuse vaccination is a global health concern called vaccine hesitancy,[40] which increases the risk of further viral spreading that could lead to ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks during 2020–21.[41] A September 2020 survey found that half of American adults surveyed said they would not accept a vaccination if it was available at that time, and three-quarters expressed concerns about the pace of the process and fears that a vaccine might be confirmed before its safety and effectiveness are fully understood.[42]"" and ""Because many vaccines cause side effects, such as pain at the injection site, headaches, and influenza symptoms, safety testing requires years of observation in thousands of clinical trial participants""

It seems there are reasonable concerns that one of the methods that could be used to accelerate the timeframe is shortening or avoiding safety trials which are obviously there for a reason. I don't have a strong enough grasp of the FDA's structure and relationship with the government to argue either side of this though",1,0.085,0.153,0.762,-0.9757
gcf7pkd,2020-11-15,">Obviously, with a 90-plus percent effective vaccine, you could feel much more confident. But I would recommend to people to not abandon all public health measures just because you have been vaccinated, because even though, for the general population, it might be 90 to 95 percent effective, you don't necessarily know, for you, how effective it is.

Ok, Dr. Fauci, if only 9 in 10 people seroconvert to have IgG (the antibody that lasts for a while and confirms clearance of a pathogen) against the SARS-CoV2 spike antigen, then there is a very simple solution: After you have received your second vaccine dose, wait a few weeks, and go get an antibody test, more specifically, a quantitative antibody test that will show a specific titer of antibodies from the vaccine. If you don't have a sufficient antibody titer, then keep on with the social distancing, and maybe get another vaccine trial if you can. If you do have a sufficient antibody titer, then you don't have to worry about those things. Otherwise, what is the bloody point of getting the vaccine?

From [this article](https://www.yalescientific.org/2020/08/08-17-news-flash-1-encouraging-results-from-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine-candidate/):

>RBD-binding Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations were detected at Day 21 for all doses and increased by Day 28 for those who received a second dose. Neutralization titers were measurable at Day 21 for all doses, and increased to substantial levels by Day 28 relative to a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera.

This doesn't even account for potential T-cell responses (as T-cells do not produce antibodies) or the formation of memory B-cells that might still produce antibodies and mount a sufficient antibody response after immune system contraction, which is also likely elicited from a vaccine that confers an IgG response that is significant relative to the sera of people who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection.",7,0.116,0.012,0.873,0.985

The proposed vaccine from Pfizer is about 90% effective by available data, and it may require 2 doses in order to be that effective. 1 in 10 people will not be immune despite receiving said vaccine course. For example, yours truly has received 3 MMR vaccines in the last 2 years because I can't seroconvert against measles for whatever reason. Sometimes vaccines don't work. Also, I think Fauci wants to ensure that since we probably need about 60% to 70% of people to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity, then he wants to make sure that enough people have received the vaccine in order for enough people to be immune so that the virus will not be able to spread (which is the epidemiological reason for any vaccine).

- As far as the personal reason:

It doesn't make a lot of sense unless you're one of the 1/10 that isn't immune after the vaccine course, and even that doesn't make a lot of sense if you're not in a vulnerable cohort. If you're young and healthy, then I wouldn't worry too much about it. However, if you're older, then I would probably get an antibody test about 4 weeks after receiving both doses of the vaccine (which seems to be the prescribed regimen).

The test subjects go about their normal(ish) lives and the researchers get updates to see who tests positive for covid-19. They found 95 positive cases so far out of all of the subjects. Then looking at the group of covid positive subjects, 90 of them received the placebo and 5 received the actual vaccine.

It transports a piece of mRNA into cells using small lipid droplets, and the cells can then express a viral epitope on their surface using molecules called major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs), which are also known as human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). This allows the immune system to recognize the viral protein and determine how to destroy it. Every cell in your body has these MHC molecules (MHC class I), and some have specialized molecules (MHC class II). This is the basis for immune cell-mediated responses for any intracellular pathogen like viruses in the clearance of an infection. Without the actual genome of the virus being replicated, but rather just a piece of mRNA that encodes the sequence for the SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein, it would be far safer to get the vaccine than it would be to contract the actual virus, especially in more vulnerable cohorts.

It's just using your body's own machinery to learn how to attack a piece of the virus that is harmless on its own but crucial to the entry of the virus into cells where it can replicate. I'm not really understanding why some people are having such an issue with it when these same people are perfectly fine with other vaccines. I think anti-vaxxers are crazy, but I can at least understand why someone who is anti-vaccine would also be against receiving a coronavirus vaccine. I can't really wrap my head around why people who aren't anti-vax have so much skepticism over the potential dangers of this vaccine, especially when no serious acute-phase side effects have been reported.

Edit: And I think that most mRNA vaccines have failed because it's hard to figure out a way to bypass cells' nucleases, which are enzymes that destroy foreign genetic material. If your cells detect foreign genetic material (either RNA or DNA), then these nucleases chop up that genetic material. I'm guessing with a nearly 95% efficacy, that these scientists have discovered a way to bypass these nucleases.

Some people can choose to wait a few years until they take one of these vaccines. But if EVERYONE decides to push against all of these vaccines for a few years just because they’re not proven 100% safe, we’re going to let the pandemic kill many more people than these vaccines would.

Even if the safest of all the vaccines being produced has a 0.01% death rate for example, it’s still better to take it than to wait years and let the pandemic kill more than 0.05% of the world’s population AND destroy most countries’ economies AND make us all suffer through a few more years of this (which would have an impact on mental health, suicide rates, social development of children and teenagers etc.).

What you’re saying is completely valid for vaccine production in normal times, but in a pandemic (which is causing a worldwide health, financial and social crisis) we have to consider that the act of waiting kills people. Even if these vaccines are not 100% safe, we still have to take them if we come to the conclusion that they will kill fewer people than the act of waiting.

gckjdpg,2020-11-16,"The things that matter in the analysis:

1. Risk of death or other serious outcome from COVID-19 infection
2. Risk of contracting COVID-19 as t --> ∞ if no action is taken
3. Risk of death or other serious outcome from COVID-19 vaccine
4. Risk of contracting COVID-19 as t --> ∞ if vaccine is taken

&#x200B;

With recent data out we can bound some of this data:

1. Case fatality rate is 2.2%. Even if we are only identifying half of the cases, it's at least 1%. Also there's a non-insignificant number that won't fully recover but let's make COVID-19 look as benign as possible and exclude those.
2. Risk of contracting COVID-19 as t--> ∞. We can use herd immunity estimates as a placeholder for this, namely 70%

Multiply the answer in 1 by the answer in 2 and you get at lowest a 0.7% chance of dying of COVID as t --> ∞, at least for the average person.

3) Risk of death or serious outcome from COVID-19 vaccine. This is the big unknown as it were but it certainly is quite safe in the short term (or the studies already conducted would have noticed).

To try to create reasonable bounds for this, let's look at the largest database of vaccine safety we have, which comes from the US vaccine injury compensation program. If we look at claims / doses, the two ""most dangerous"" vaccines (and they are all extremely safe) are diptheria-tetanus combo and tetanus. Tetanus is the ""least safe"" at a 0.00162% chance of resulting in a claim after administration, roughly 1 in 620,000 administrations will result in a claim.

Let's think about worst case scenario and assume that tetanus is actually 10 times more dangerous than that, but only a small handful of people that deserve compensation are compensated. That makes it a 0.0162% chance of harm.

Let's take another wild leap and say that the COVID-19 vaccine is a further 10 times more dangerous than the most dangerous vaccine we currently use, and say the chance in harm is 0.162%. Thanks to these generous assumptions, we can be very confident that the true risk is much lower than this, but like I said we are bounding the problem.

4) Easier calculation here, just take the answer in part 2 \* (1-the efficacy). Let's say 80% in case the vaccine underperforms initial data. This is 14% Then multiply this by risk of dying because the vaccine didn't work (part 1) and you get 0.14% chance of death because the vaccine didn't protect you.

Then we add part 3 and part 4 to get a 0.3% chance of harm from the vaccine as the absolute worst case scenario.

So

Best case scenario for unchecked coronavirus is 0.7% but is likely higher

and

Worst case scenario for the vaccine is 0.3% but is likely lower

Even if this vaccine is 100 times less safe than the ""least safe"" (but again actually very safe) vaccine we have today, it still makes sense to get the vaccine instead of just waiting for herd immunity from the virus.

Edit: I should point out that the more likely scenario based on the best data we have right now is:

Coronavirus risk: 1.4%

Vaccine risk: 0.07% (almost all of which is from the vaccine not working and you still getting coronavirus, rather than any risk due to the vaccine itself)

gcmg3cw,2020-11-16,"I mean, he clearly had input as far as the design of Operation Warp Speed. It's not like he just sits there and waits for things to come across his desk. Like with any other bill, the president has discussions with people in Congress to ensure that he will sign whatever does eventually arrive at his desk. I don't think it's so bold to say that.

As far as the task force, I'm not entirely certain what a designated task force is going to do at this time that isn't and hasn't been done. He still has input from members of his task force as far as the policy that he wants to address. Those same members of the task force gave advice to the president as Operation Warp Speed was drafted.

As far as masks, there is a whole scientific reasoning as to why masks aren't the end-all-be-all of a pandemic response, but they can help in the acute scenario. Keep in mind too that originally scientists were telling people not to wear masks because the data at the time didn't show that they were particularly effective at reducing viral transmission; some of the data changed. Regardless of what the president says (and I think you're right to point out that he could have made better comments on masks) people are going to wear them. I mean, I live in Florida, and there's no mask mandate here yet people are still largely wearing them. People are going to make their own risk assessments. The same goes for rallies.

People are going to make their own risk assessment for going to a rally. Would I go to one? No. I'm around too many at-risk people all of the time, and I haven't had the virus yet. I need to take my own precautions. Is anyone being forced to go to those rallies? Absolutely not, but if they think it's within their risk assessment to go to a rally, then that's their choice. 

But I think you need to look at some of the good things that he did too when making an assessment of his pandemic response. The travel ban from China and Europe was largely criticized as being xenophobic, yet it turned out to be the right decision. In January, nobody was taking this pandemic all that seriously, and many scientists thought it may not be any worse than a common flu season as far as the impacts of coronavirus on mortality; they were wrong, but again, science is often about being wrong. He also held meetings with Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, and other experts to determine pandemic-mitigating policy and recommendations were applied in many cases tot he best of his ability. We also had research into pharmaceuticals and treatment options that have resulted in a better understanding of how to care for coronavirus patients. The idea of coming out with an effective antibody cocktail within months is absurd; on average, it takes 10 years for a new pharmaceutical treatment to reach the market, and now we have several for a pandemic that started less than a year ago. The same thing goes for the absurdly fast production of a vaccine. The fastest that any previous vaccine was developed before this was the mumps vaccine, and that took **four years** to develop. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies were able to produce these treatments in such an expeditious manner due to the policies and incentives from the Trump administration. I really can't think of a whole lot of people who would have handled this better given what we knew at the time. It's a little hard to look back with 20/20 hindsight on some stuff when the scientific data that we have now weren't available to us then. For that reason, I don't think it's so bold to praise his covid response.

you may have noticed that SARS-COV-1 stopped spreading rather quickly. Multiple candidates were in phase 2 and 3 but pulled the plug when the disease came to a halt. The structure of these coronaviruses actually makes vaccine development much easier than for a virus like HIV or Polio, HIV in particular being extremely complex. All of the data is there for you to look at, none of this is happening behind closed doors. Moderna had legitimate side effects in phase 1, they altered doses and phase 2 went much more smoothly. No one is hiding that.

They also have purchase guarantees from the feds, even if they flop in phase 3 they still get paid, so the incentive is to have a safe one rather than any one.

Socialism is not what you're thinking. Socialism is worker ownership of the means of production.

(There is of course also state-socialism, which is effectively just state-capitalism (i.e. stalinism) but with a representative government. This is justified as socialist because an organization representative of the workers controls the means of production, but many modern socialists do not consider it a valid form of socialism, and see it as no different than state-capitalism.)

In a socialist country, the scientist would receive the full value of his contribution in profits.

Imagine how enthusiastic a scientist developing a vaccine would be if at the end of his accomplishment he received, not a wage from the man who owns what he's produced, but instead full ownership himself, entitling him to all the profit. Imagine if by working harder and faster, he got paid sooner, and more. That's socialism.

For the record I'm not here to debate whether socialism is good or bad. Rather, I just want you to attack what it actually is, if you have a problem with it. The ""supposedly socialist utopia"" you've painted here is a stalinist (i.e. [state capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism)) regime. If you want to prove socialism won't work, you have to actually know what it is, and attack that - no amount of attacks against stalinism will convince a socialist that their beliefs are wrong, because they will agree with the vast majority of your complaints, and do not believe in what you are criticizing.

Here’s what we do know: The Pfizer clinical trial enrolled 43,538 participants, of whom 94 (about two-tenths of 1%) were identified as having COVID-19. The Moderna clinical trial included more than 30,000 participants, of whom 95 (about three-tenths of 1%) were categorized as having COVID-19. In other words: The vaccine is being tested on people who are at incredibly low risk of COVID-19 — not only the vaccinated enrollees but also the unvaccinated.

When you read headlines touting the Pfizer jab as “more than 90 percent effective” and the Moderna jab as “94.5 percent effective” in protecting against the coronavirus, ask yourselves this: How did the vaccine trial officials define a positive COVID-19 case?

According to a highly critical article in the British Medical Journal, which reviewed the details of all the ongoing phase III COVID vaccine trials released to date, “laboratory confirmed infections even with only mild symptoms qualify as meeting the primary endpoint definition. In Pfizer and Moderna’s trials, for example, people with only a cough and positive laboratory test” qualify as COVID-19 positive cases. Astra Zeneca’s paused COVID-19 vaccine trial allowed a mere cough and fever with a positive PCR test to qualify as a positive case. Final efficacy analyses are planned after vaccine trial officials document a measly 150-160 “events” (positive indications of symptomatic COVID-19, regardless of illness severity).

The BMJ author, associate editor Peter Doshi, pointed out that none of the trials underway “are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths. Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.” This is in stark contrast to how the trials have been marketed to the public as assessing the vaccine’s impact on preventing severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalizations and deaths.

Moderna’s own chief medical officer told the BMJ that the company’s trial lacks adequate statistical power to assess severe COVID-19 outcomes. That’s because hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 “are simply too uncommon in the population being studied for an effective vaccine to demonstrate statistically significant differences in a trial of 30,000 people. The same is true of its ability to save lives or prevent transmission: the trials are not designed to find out.” Bottom line: COVID-19 is too rare and too benign to permit analysis of exactly the kind of serious health outcomes that most Americans believe the vaccine will “cure.”

Vaccinating billions of people to prevent a disease with a 99% survival rate for people under 70 — all based on clinical trial efficacy analysis of less than 200 COVID-19 cases involving patients with coughs and unreliable PCR tests with significant false positive rates — is not the triumph of science.

Jonas Salk's Polio Vaccine wasn't a cure, if given to someone who had previously been affected by Polio earlier in life, it did not rid them of the diseases lasting effects.

gcq1urx,2020-11-18,"mRNA vaccines tend to have stability issues, and often require being stored at low temperatures.  This is a known issue. Vaccine researchers try to find ways to avoid it, but it is not always possible. 

The mRNA vaccine that Pfizer has requires being stored at -80C. Distributing the Pfizer vaccine will be difficult because of this, particularly in rural and undeveloped areas. 

The Modena mRNA vaccine requires -20C storage. It will be much easier to distribute.

Pfizer and Modena both took similar approaches (mRNA vaccine that targets covid spike proteins). It's likely that Pfizer reached a point where they had a vaccine that looked good, but needed -80C, and decided that dealing with -80C was better than restarting. 

The two vaccines both appear to have similar effectiveness. There are still checkpoints they have to pass - something may be found that prevents them from getting FDA approval- and manufacturing takes time. 

Assuming both get approved and work, we could see a scenario where the Pfizer vaccine is distributed in areas that have access to -80C and the Modena one is distributed in areas that don't. For example, let's say that on February 1st there are 10,000 doses of each available and earmarked for military use.

1. It was done so fast so there is obviously something wrong with it!

Ans: The only reason the vaccine was completed within a year compared to other vaccines is simply FUNDING. Unlike other vaccines the Covid-19 one had billions of dollars pumped into it from start. Every other vaccine only gets funding after results are already promising.
Another reason for it's quick inception is due to our experience with the coronavirus. We already had data available from a different strand in 2003(?). 


2. There must be side effects so I'll wait for others!

Ans: Of course there MIGHT be side effects to the vaccine, they are just nowhere near as dangerous as getting the virus itself. TWO seperate companies made the vaccine over 95% effective and they are STILL testing it on people to ensure it's effectiveness. 


3. I'll take my chances with Coronavirus since it has a 99.85% survival rate!

Ans: No, no it doesn't. The main thing with Covid is that it effects different people in a vastly different regard. One person might only have flu-like symptoms (like my aunt) and other people can die within weeks. You would rather take a vaccine shot that has results to back ut up then risk literally dying or letting a close family member die. 



The vaccine WILL be useless if people don't take it. For the pandemic to truly end we need everyone to have the vaccine so no one can catch Covid and spread it. The more people who deny the vaccine the longer we will be stuck in our homes and eat up savings.

This coronavirus won't go away until we've reached herd immunity, and you're only going to get to herd immunity in one of two ways: a vaccine or recovery (or death) from infection. So then you have to ask yourself if you'd rather try your chances with a vaccine that is not in Phase 4 market surveillance, or do you want to take your chances by getting the virus and recovering. I guess a third option would be to try and avoid it while herd immunity is achieved by everyone else either getting infected or getting vaccinated, but there is no guarantee that you can avoid the virus. 

I know that personally, I will get the vaccine if presented with the opportunity to do so provided that I don't get the coronavirus first (obviously, why vaccinate if you're already immune). I'm around older and vulnerable people a lot, and I'd rather be a barrier to protection for them rather than a vector for disease transmission to them.

gcyr55n,2020-11-20,"It doesn't. People don't understand how this works. I'll try to put this in a way for the layman to understand, but it does have to be a little technical.

The parts of the cells in your body that carry out specific actions are called proteins. Proteins are made in your cells when RNA is made from DNA. Think of DNA like the books in a library that hold all of the information for making proteins. The RNA is a copy of that information from the books, and it allows these things called ribosomes to build proteins. The proteins can then be used to do a number of things. So in a way, those books are kind of like instructional books for building things. Say you wanted to build a table, but you didn't know how. The books have instructions for building the table that you can then use. In this analogy, the table is the protein.

This vaccine is a piece of RNA that allows the ribosomes to build the proteins. It completely skips the DNA process, and instead goes right to the building of the proteins at the ribosome. This RNA has the information that helps your ribosomes build a piece of the coronavirus that is not harmful, and those cells can then show those proteins to your immune system. Your immune system can then figure out how to attack that protein, so when you come in contact with the actual coronavirus, it will recognize that protein and kill it quickly.

gcywyhv,2020-11-20,"Clearly not my field but...

I have heard the rona is an RNA virus.  And the simplified explanation I got, is for example HIV is an RNA virus, which mutates every single time it jumps to a new host making a vaccine impossible.  In this simplified model, wouldn't it suggest covid is likely to mutate as well making a vaccine useless?",1,0.068,0.056,0.876,-0.0516
gcz0zwv,2020-11-20,"There are a lot of RNA viruses, so that's a really broad category. It's like calling it an American-made car. Well ok? Is it made by Ford, GM, Chevrolet? Is it a Mustang or a Silverado? What kind of horsepower does it have? Should I take my Corvette off-roading, or am I better off doing that in a Jeep?

The same thing can be said of RNA viruses, which include things like the common cold (influenza), measles, mumps, HIV, coronavirus, polio, and some hepatitis viruses. All of those are pretty different. Right? Being an RNA virus just means that it has an RNA genome. A genome is a collection of all of an organism's genetic information. A human genome is made of DNA, and that's where our genes come from. These two viruses have an RNA genome, and that's where their genes come from.

One of these differences is their relative rates of mutation. The reason that it's so hard to make an effective vaccine for HIV or the flu is because they have really high rates of mutation. This coronavirus mutates at a rate that is half as quick as the flu and a quarter of that as HIV, which is enormous. Just think: if I have a virus that starts out with one mutation, then goes to two in one day, four in the next, eight after that, etc., then it would take a month to get 1 billion mutations. But if I have a virus that mutates every 6 hours, then I only need a week to get 1 billion mutations, and it gets a lot bigger as time progresses. This coronavirus mutates at an especially sluggish rate, so the threat of a consequential mutation is unlikely, especially as we approach the herd immunity threshold.

Not only that, but some mutations are completely invisible. If I change one piece of DNA, sometimes, that doesn't change the protein. Think of it like two sentences that don't exactly have the same wording but tell the same story. You and your buddy might have a different way of telling a fishing story, but the bottom line is that the story is probably generally the same (though your buddy probably says he caught the bigger fish). These mutations would have to mutate in a specific way to change the outcome of the protein being targeted in order for the mutation to have any meaning. I mean, even the cells in healthy people's bodies have millions of mutations, but that doesn't mean that their cells have changed all that much.

Hey man what evidence do you have that lockdowns didn’t work ? In the first wave of lockdowns it lowered the infection rate in some places almost 80%.
An effective lockdown with social distancing can really save a lot of American lives. In the article below, specifically take a look at the case studies it really
shows the change.

Also masks, more specifically n95 masks drastically lower your chance of spreading a virus. This has been released by the cdc and well as the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
Wearing a mask is not a protection for yourself, but it isto stop the spread of it to others.
This can also really help save American lives.

And the rushed vaccine i understand, but the data so far is showing good results and the long lasting effects are in the extremely rare category, so it’s on par with the other known vaccines.

I remember reading a statement in the package insert that there was just over 1 million cases of GBS after that vaccine in ‘76 but they couldn’t ever figure out what specifically in the vaccine caused it so they attributed the flu vaccine in general to be suspect of it. So that is why they ask you every year when you get a flu shot if you have ever had GBS because the flu shot could reactivate it. 

I remember reading some language in the package insert that basically said something along the lines of “it was such a small amount of people who got GBS that its not that big of a deal to worry about because chances are slim to none that it will happen to you”. 

As a healthcare worker I don’t get the flu shot, I don’t see the need for it since the efficacy is usually somewhere in the 30% range. Im generally healthy and in my early 30’s so I take other precautions such as regular hand washing, mostly a balanced diet, and avoiding potentially infectious encounters as much as possible. I haven’t had the flu or flu like symptoms in all of my adult life. Last time was in my teens. 

I never specifically encourage someone to get the vaccine.

gecpzxl,2020-12-02,"The formation of so-called “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats, for example. In the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus.

The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.

The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). 70% of people develop antibodies against this substance – this means that many people can develop allergic, potentially fatal reactions to the vaccination.

The much too short duration of the study does not allow a realistic estimation of the late effects. As in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow. Nevertheless, BioNTech/Pfizer apparently submitted an application for emergency approval on December 1, 2020.

State law prohibits the requirement of any vaccine. However, employers can set other requirements that are reasonable in regards to the prevention of the spread of a disease.

gf8zry7,2020-12-06,"I was thinking about this a few weeks ago. 

Years ago, I flew, on a full plane, without a mask, when I had the flu. I didn’t know I had the flu (I thought it was a hangover). I have no way of knowing if anyone around me got infected, and if they did, then passed away OR passed the virus on to someone who then passed away. I also don’t know if, prior to 2020, having the flu would have necessarily stoped me from traveling if I didn’t feel very ill. The flu manifests itself differently every year in every person. Sometimes and in some people it could feel as if it’s just a cold or bad cough and not go to the doctor to confirm they have the flu. The flu is a good example because it can be as deadly as COVID in high-risk individuals, and probably even more deadly in perfectly healthy people (compared to COVID) and far more deadly in children (than COVID).

This goes for other viruses too. Think about how many people have had HPV at some point in their lives, didn’t know, and infected someone else who later developed terminal cancer (cervical, throat, etc.). Does that mean, a person who develops cervical cancer or throat cancer, years and years later, as a direct consequence of contracting HPV should have the right to track down and blame every one of their sex partners? For some people that could be 10+ 20+ 50+ people. It could have been one of those 20 or it could have been five of 20 that passed the HPV. Somewhere around 13,000 to 14,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year. 4,000 to 5,000 women die of cervical cancer every year. That’s a lot (and very sad - I don’t want to discount the emotional aspect of this) in general, but if we’re playing in the MSM COVID world, it’s absolutely catastrophic. There’s a vaccine for HPV, but even if you got the vaccine, that doesn’t mean you won’t become infected or be able to infect someone else. Using protection (a condom could act as a mask in this analogy) is not a guarantee that you won’t contract HPV.

All of this is to show, like you said, that unless you (not you specifically, you as in the people making unreasonable and extreme judgments of people they have no contact or involvement with) are 100% certain you have never innocently and/or indirectly passed an infection on to someone else that resulted in their or their direct contact’s death or long-term/continued health problems, or even their future health issues, then I think you need to take a hard look in the mirror and assess how you are treating the people around you who are taking risks you yourself would not take. Even if those risks are completely reasonable (socializing with a small number of family or friends after everyone has taken the proper precautions and produced a COVID-19 negative test). 

This was kind of all over the place and I’m sorry for that and for the length. This topic has been on my mind since the Thanksgiving holiday when many people had their hair on fire about others traveling to see their families for the holidays.

- US government ordered enough Pfizer vaccines to vaccinate 50 million people (15% of population). And it said that it won't ship any oversea.
- The European union has ordered enough of this vaccine for 150 million people (33%) of population. And it seems it doesn't take into account some member states, like Spain, who ordered additional doses on their own (not 100% certain I'm correct).

Any order that the US makes now, would be prioritized after the EU order. Rather than promising not to ship any to foreign countries, Trump should order more doses, before other countries do so. The US government rejected a possibility to order more Pfizer vaccines during summer, that mistake is 100 times more impactful (for the US) than today's EO.

The EU will probably give away many of their vaccines. But that's because they ordered way too many for their own population (e.g. France ordered for 100M people, while their population is 60M people, and not everybody will take the vaccines).

gf25t6s,2020-12-07,"That's not true. BioNTech, the German company, started intense vaccine development already back in *January*. They essentially cancelled all vacations and other projects and directed all their efforts into developing the vaccine.

Later in March, they partnered with Pfizer, a US pharma giant who has the muscle and money to run clinical trials and manufacture and distribute the vaccine on a large scale. They've also partnered with the Chinese company Fosun pharma, who handles manufacturing and distribution for the Chinese market (I suppose the Chinese media is talking about the ""Fosun"" vaccine, lol). They ran trials and studies on two continents simultaneously. BioNtech has gotten funding for the development for the vaccine from Fosun Pharma ($135 million in exchange of shares), German government ($445 million), European commission and European investment bank ($119 million). Pfizer has been funding its US portion of the development and the clinical trials on private money of its own.

The US government has **not** participated in the development or funding of the BNT162b2 vaccine in any way. Operation Warp Speed was announced on *May* 15, while BioNtech-Pfizer had already started phase I trials on two continents. Warp Speed tried to claim they're working with Pfizer but Pfizer corrected them. (However, the US govt did make an advance order for 100 mil doses, and some feel that could be seen as funding.)

So, at least the BNT162b2, aka Pfizer-BioNTech, aka Pfizer vaccine definitely would exist without Trump. It might probably exist even without Pfizer, since BioNTech from Mainz, Germany developed it - Pfizer is huge but it's not the only big pharma company in the world. It might have just taken them quite a bit longer, but they were working hard on it already months before Trump ever started ""pushing"" for the development of a vaccine, back when he was still saying the virus is going to miraculously go away in April when it gets warmer, or that the USA only has basically 5 cases and they're going to recover and there's no cause to worry, or later when he was pushing hydroxychloroquine.

There's lots of other vaccines also being developed right now by different companies worldwide, such as the Moderna one, and the US government has funded several promising projects with a great deal of money, that's true.

However there is no “red tape” to cut through until the clinical trials, which require IRB approval.

Okay so this is a tiny bit to unpack. One of Biden’s chosen scientific advisors [Dr. Zeke Emanuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Emanuel) published a [paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1309) that said basically (I’m paraphrasing) ""if you have vaccinated 90% of the population you should start shipping out the vaccine to other countries where they are doing worse, ***before finishing vaccinating the last 10%""***. Fox News jumped on this an wrote an article called:  [Coronavirus adviser wants US to distribute vaccine globally before it's available to all Americans](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-coronavirus-adviser-emanuel-vaccine-distribution?fbclid=IwAR2kXEFxT6APh6YQ81rAT8p-UopgBRNb6oT-O9GN6GDMaM7L0zFxJAgKay)

The title is ***very very very misleading***, the full paper without paywalls can be read here: [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1309](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1309)

The title states ""... adviser wants US to distribute vaccine globally before it's available to *all* Americans""

The use of the word ALL is the problem. This article implies that we should vaccinate every single man woman and child in the US (the ""all"" in the title) before we should send any vaccinations to struggling countries. The thing is ***epidemiologically this is not necessary. If enough of the population is immunized the ""infectivity"" of the virus drops to the point that it is not an absolute emergency to vaccinate the remaining population.***

He says it better in paragraph 6 (pg1):

>""The marginal benefit of additional doses of vaccine in a country able to keep Rt below 1 generally will pale in comparison to the potential benefits to countries whose Rt remains above 1""

(Rt \[R""naught\] is a statistical way to describe the infectivity of a virus in a given population).

But going back to the title people see that “**TOP SCIENTIST WANTS TO VACCINATE OTHERS BEFORE** ^(\[every single man/woman/child/dog\]) **AMERICANS**” They must be an unamerican shill!! ...Therefore there is panic/distrust/and political finger-pointing.

1. Identify a protein of interest (spike protein in this case).

2. Sequence the code for the protein.

3. Use bacteria to replicate the RNA for you (process established, works the same for any protein).

4. Coat the mRNA in a fat to let it sneak into your cells (process established, works the same for any protein, but proprietary, some are better than others, that's why Moderna's vaccine doesn't need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer).

This would essentially render women infertile for an indefinite period of time post-vaccination.

There are already many ""fact checkers"" and ""verification"" articles supposedly debunking this claim. I recommend that you read these articles. You'll see that they focus on attacking Yeadon and Wodarg as ""vaccine skeptics"" or spreading ""pandemic misinformation,"" or interview other scientists who say the placenta problem is ""very unlikely"" (but carefully avoid ruling it out). There is no clinical trial data on whether the vaccine could actually affect placenta formation (not to mention other aspects of fertility), and Pfizer has refused to comment at all on the possibility.

It probably doesn’t. There was some sensationalistic reporting on it, but the number of cases in vaccinated subjects wasn’t actually more than what you’d expect in a given random sample of the same size. 


> Why do children conceived by IVF have a 67% higher chance of developing leukemia?


A finding in a single study based on a very small number of cases. Tough to know if this phenomenon is real. 


> Why does hair loss medication reduce libido in some men and increase it in others?


These medications work by reducing levels of dihydrotestosterone by inhibiting a specific enzyme. Any time you alter a metabolic pathway you cause changes in the levels of earlier metabolites in that pathway. DHT is a powerful androgen, so it would be expected that it would decrease libido in many. Reports of increased libido are few and far between, but likely have to do with alterations in the levels of other hormones. 


> What is the root cause of endometriosis?


There are multiple viable theories, each with a feasible proposed mechanism. 


> Why does breastmilk protect against sudden infant death syndrome?


Breast fed babies wake up more easily, and have stronger immune systems. SIDS is usually suffocation during sleep, respiratory infections increase the risk. 


> We don't know. I think we need to tread very carefully here.


We don’t know for certain in all of these cases, but we have plausible mechanisms. That simply does not exist in the allegation those fellows made. 



Would I give the vaccine to a pregnant or breastfeeding woman? Probably not till it’s been studied for that purpose, as that’s pretty basic medical ethics. That being said, there is no reason to think that this vaccine will somehow render people infertile. In fact we know with absolute certainty it won’t so what those two characters were alleging, because if it did, we already would have detected COVID doing the same thing. A brief summary of how mRNA vaccines work:


The vaccine contains tiny bubbles filled with mRNA that merge with your cells to get the mRNA inside them. mRNA is a molecule that acts as short-lived (half-life of hours) instructions on how to build a specific protein. In this case, the Covid spike protein (whole protein or just the very tip that actually sticks to your cells, depending on the vaccine). After that protein gets made, your cells will stick it in a special receptacle on their surface which passing white blood cells inspect. When they find the foreign protein, they use it to make antibodies and T-cells that will target that particular protein. 


If you were to become infected by COVID, this same process would occur, accept you’d also have a multiplying virus in your body destroying cells and causing all sorts of nastiness. Since COVID doesn’t render people infertile via antibodies created against its spike protein, we already know that the vaccine won’t, because it uses this same exact spike protein. 


Is it POSSIBLE that the mRNA vaccines cause some serious side effect that occurs so rarely we haven’t detected in in the tens of thousands who’ve gotten the vaccine? Sure. But any ill effect it caused would be one that COVID already caused itself (since any mechanism by which the vaccine could cause injury would also apply to the virus, since the vaccine is literally just making your cells make one tiny piece of the virus for a few hours), and COVID causes serious adverse events (including death) far more often than 1/40,000. 


At the end of the day, it’s your call, but I’d encourage you to talk with your doctor about it. Luckily, if you’re healthy (and I hope you are!), you won’t need to make a decision for at least 3-4 months (and possibly more like 5-8), so there will be tens of millions of guinea pigs in the US alone you can look at to help you make up your mind.",0,0.106,0.068,0.826,0.9827

The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the virus that causes COVID-19. ""COVID"" itself stands for ""Coronavirus Disease"", as in the disease caused by the coronavirus. For simplicity sake, this can be compared to HIV, a virus, causing AIDS, a disease.

What the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines do is provide your cells with a set of instructions to replicate a certain spike protein found on the cells of the coronavirus itself. Your cells then start making said spike protein. Your body recognizes that this spike protein created by your cells isn't supposed to be there, so it creates antibodies to fight against it. Thus, if later on you are infected with the coronavirus, your body already has the proper antibodies to fight against it, and prevent it from causing COVID.

However, these antibodies don't stop the coronavirus from entering your body completely. Therefore, its entirely possible to possess the virus even after being vaccinated.

It is suggesting that, because we turn around flu vaccines year after year we should have been able to do the same for this virus.

Flu vaccines are usually a direct analysis of the opposing hemisphere's seasonal strains and previous year's prominent influenza.

Additionally, it is unethical to purposefully infect someone with a virus to test the efficiency of a vaccine. Phase 3 of vaccine trials take a good amount of time partly because the people are given it and then they just... live their lives.

This is untrue. Pfizer has made it absolutely clear that they had no part in operation warp speed. Their vaccine is fully independently researched and manufactured which is why they are under no obligation to sell the initial batches/doses to the US government. 

This is why Trump recently passed an executive order saying that american companies have to provide vaccines developed for covid to the US first because his operation warp speed didn't contribute to Pfizers work.

Not fake news at all. Do you read your own article and do you know what operation warp speed is? Operation warp provides funding on the grounds that the government gets first dibs. That's all. Pfizer got 0 dollars from operation warp speed. 

Read your own article. The health secretary just wants to make it seem like they are a part of the program by saying the US government has a contract to BUY vaccines but Pfizer was under no obligation to actually sign that contract. Had they been under operation warp speed they would have no choice. 

He then goes on to say that they will help distribute? Of course. The US bought vaccines, what do they plan to do with them once they have them? Let them sit in shelves? You can't claim that because you need to buy means of distributing them that all of a sudden you are helping pfizer develop the vaccine.

This transaction was outside of warp speed. Their argument is that the money the US is going to pay Pfizer for this vaccine is only available because of operation warp speed and that's why they claim there's a ""partial responsibility"". The money wouldn't be there if it wasn't for warp speed.

> Jesse Goodman, the former chief scientist of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, agreed that the U.S. government deserves credit for the high priority placed on Operation Warp Speed.

> ""This is a bright spot in the pandemic response. I mean, the rest of it has been dismal,"" said Goodman, who is also director of Georgetown University's Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.

> Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also lauded Operation Warp Speed for being a ""success — certainly in the arena of vaccines, it's been a success"" in his remarks at a recent virtual summit organized by the medical news site Stat.

> Launched in May, Operation Warp Speed (OWS) is a government initiated private/public $10 billion US program to help provide support to companies in the development, manufacturing and distribution of 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, with the aim of having initial doses ready by January 2021

> The experts agree that Operation Warp Speed played a significant role in Moderna's development of a potential vaccine. 

> ""Without OWS, there would be no Moderna vaccine. Period,"" Dai said.

> Allison Winnike, president of the Texas-based Immunization Partnership, an organization providing advocacy and information about immunization initiatives, said that Moderna benefited tremendously from Operation Warp Speed, in part, by receiving close to $1 billion to support its vaccine development and clinical trials.

Of course OWS and Pfizer don't have a perfect relationship, but please stop saying they have no involvement or didn't help. *You* might say they didn't help based on your personal perception of what is truly ""helpful,"" but if the experts are saying it helped, then obviously I'm going to take their word over your opinion.",1,0.17,0.061,0.769,0.9962

Its like you read the first part of the sentence but ignore everything else. The guy is basically saying, well since OWS is in affect it had some influence but that influence would have had no difference if OWS wasn't there. 

Besides, the health secretary already confirmed, from your own quoted article in your previous post what OWS did. It made then sign a contract. That is all. No money has changed hands. Which confirms pfizers original remark that OWS might as well not even be a thing as far as it concerns them. The vaccine was and has been completely worked in house with no assistance from the US government. A contract to sell you stuff after it's completed does not equal they helped. 

>""I can't see this large an effort by this many companies going forward in this fashion without substantial support that has come [through] Operation Warp Speed.""

If you want to consider experts then the only two experts that matter is the health secretary who has direct knowledge of OSW in regard to pfizer and basically said ""we have a contract to buy once it's developed"" and the pfizer representatives who said ""we didn't receive any help from the US government. Those are the only two statements that matter. 

As for moderna I'm not sure why you are bringing them up. I'm only concerned with pfizer whos vaccine is currently the best option in terms of trials and results.

He said government will buy product from Pfizer, government will ship their bought items to who they want. They aren't aiding Pfizer. They are doing what you would expect the government to do with their new property of rightfully purchased vaccines.

No you can say that about a claim that says ""we have a contract to buy products"" and therefore we assisted in that product being developed. That's nonsense.

That's just blatantly false. You're playing the game of ""Well, they got COVID, but what *really* killed them was X.""

It doesn't matter. **Underlying** causes are not necessarily **fatal** causes; if you got COVID while having heart problems and die as a result of your heart giving out, COVID is what killed you, because if you hadn't caught COVID, you would still be alive. It's extremely dehumanizing and misleading to claim or imply that because someone died of complications while having secondary conditions, that invalidates their death caused by the pandemic.

If anything we are likely [vastly undercounting](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) the number of COVID deaths due to a variety of factors, including lack of testing early among other complications. We were at [300,000 excess deaths](https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/20/cdc-data-excess-deaths-covid-19/) in October, and while some issues regarding medical care have arisen with COVID, traffic fatalities are down as a whole, and airborne diseases (like the seasonal flu) are (so far, fingers crossed) down due to increased mask wearing cutting down on other diseases as well. So even excess deaths may not encompass the full scope of what we are seeing.

>Vaccine trials have already caused severe anaphylactic shock, bells palsy, and death, among other issues.

Let's just tackle these with the Pfizer vaccine. Partially because its been approved, partially because it's my favorite.

**Anaphylactic Shock:** Out of tens of thousands of patients in the Pfizer vaccine trials, [there were two confirmed anaphylactic reactions and one possible](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine-idUSKBN28J1D1) after the UK began a mass-vaccination process. [Two nurses, both of whom had a history of having these sorts of reactions (specifically to vaccines)](https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/09/pfizer-vaccine-uk-body-tells-people-with-history-of-allergic-reactions-not-to-get-jab-yet) and were carrying around adrenaline auto-injectors specifically because they are familiar with these reactions.

**Bells Palsy:** While it may be true that there were four cases of Bell's Palsy during the trial, that was out of 38,000 participants. [The rate of occurrence in the general population is about 20 in 100,000](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/covid-vaccine-bells-palsy).

**Death:** This one is just misleading. It's a trial involving tens of thousands of people across multiple areas of the world. Some of them are going to die. And guess what? There were six deaths during the trial... [Two of them got the vaccine, four of them got a placebo, and none of them were related to either treatment.](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pfizer-health-concerns-idUSKBN28K2R6).

But let's just assume that all of these things are the fault of the vaccine. Two cases of anaphylactic shock, four cases of Bell's Palsy, and two deaths, out of 38,000 patients. 8 negative occurrences, only two of which were fatal.

Even for the 18-29 range (the lowest age range likely to be vaccinated, and the safest with regards to COVID), the fatality for COVID is estimated anywhere from .05-.2%. That's five in every ten thousand people dying from this disease. Even if you round it down to .01% (Because people love to scream **99.99% survival rate for young adults!** even though most data doesn't back that up), that would be FOUR people dying of COVID out of 40,000, twice the number who died during the trial **of unrelated reasons**.

Now add in those who would have lived, but now face medical bills, hospitalization, loss of work, lung damage, heart damage, brain damage, liver damage, kidney damage, testicular damage, shortness of breath for extended periods of time or permanent loss of function, decreased cognitive function, loss of smell, loss of taste, etc... etc...

Arguing the Pfizer vaccine is causing death and disability is like arguing normal vaccines cause autism. First, no, they absolutely don't, because correlation isn't causation and when you sample a large enough group of people, *someone* will have *something* bad happen to them. But second, even if it **did**, the occurrence rate is not only lower than that of an unvaccinated population, but the outcomes are *remarkably* better than *death*.",1,0.092,0.206,0.702,-0.9989

gfi9lg8,2020-12-11,">What do you think about the aging population prediction from a few years ago?

I think it doesn't explain a sudden increase in deaths of (in **one** year) that nearly doubles the increase of the % of deaths per capita *of the last five years combined*.

>I don't really follow how this applies to anything: ""...extremely dehumanizing.... invalidates their death..."" Death is sad, no matter how you die.

You are implying that these people didn't *really* die of COVID, they died of other stuff *while having* COVID. But COVID causes complications, which result in excess and early deaths. COVID **is** the cause of their death. You are handwaving their loss to a tragically mishandled pandemic, and insisting they would have died anyway.

>As far as the with/by covid goes, there is a lot of financial incentive to add covid as a cause of death. When someone is really sick, any virus could be their last. It doesn't make sense to me to say that a virus was responsible for a terminally ill patient's death. If that person were healthy and caught covid, they would have likely recovered.

It *is* true that Medicare provides more money *for the treatment* of COVID patients in order to support hospitals during this difficult time. However it is not dependent on the patient's death, requires a probable or confirmed diagnosis, and even if you ignore those factors, there has been very little to no evidence of any intentional misdiagnoses, and almost no professionals believe a doctor would risk their integrity (and potentially medical license) to earn more money for their hospital.

>Were any of the vaccine trial participants elderly or immune vulnerable? They used to run trials on healthy people only.

Of course they were; the elderly are the most vulnerable, any vaccine should be required to protect them. [Pfizer had a 94% effectiveness rate for 65+, and 41% of the participants were over 55.](https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2020/11/23/COVID-19-vaccine-hope-for-older-adults-AstraZeneca-Pfizer-Moderna-trial-data)

>The Pfizer vaccine articles states, "" Resuscitation facilities should be available at all times for all vaccinations. Vaccination should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available. "" That does not reflect confidence in the product.

Much like the list of side effects on most of the medications you take, this is purely a liability concern. [The resuscitation center comment is specifically in line with the potential for allergic reaction](https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-updates-british-officials-say-pfizer-vaccine-should-not-be-taken-people-significant-allergic-reactions), something *almost every* vaccine carries warnings for. The Pfizer vaccine doesn't even contain some of the allergens present in most other vaccines, like egg. Again, *two* people had allergic reactions, who had histories of allergic reactions **and specifically had a history of allergic reactions to vaccines**.

>That does not reflect confidence in the product.

You should try reading the list of warnings for almost any OTC medication. Aspirin side effects lists usually include in their ""serious symptoms/call your doctor"" section a variety of things, like fevers lasting three days or longer, hallucinations, and seizures. And that is **Aspirin**. The thing most people have sitting on the shelf for easy access.

>About the 2 who died. What if they would have lived long lives, even catching covid, if it were not for the vaccine that killed them?

***If*** that were the case (which it very much isn't) then yes, that would be sad... which is why it's so relieving that of all the people in the study (again, almost 40k) **two** people died of **non-vaccine related complications** who received the vaccine, while **four people receiving a placebo** died of **non-vaccine related complications**.

Also, let's be honest for a moment, going back to this ---

That means we can start vaccinating middle and high schoolers around September and (because we don't have to wait to stock up as it's the same vaccine as adults get) virtually all adolescents will be vaccinated by November.

What needs to be achieved is that people need to get vaccinated, then keep wearing masks.  Even though things won't be normal-normal, we could get infection rates low enough by June to be mostly normal.  We could have summer vacations, etc.  School will return in the Fall as the vaccine rolls out to adolescents and all the teachers have been vaccinated.",-2,0.008,0.025,0.966,-0.4404

On Jan 10 Chinese researches published the sequenced genome on the novel coronavirus. Within 66 days, a working vaccine was developed.

This is mainly due to advancements in genetics and cellular biology. Within a *week* of the genetics being sequenced, synthetic mRNA was already being produced. This is the basis of all mRNA vaccines.

mRNA vaccines are genius, extremely safe, and extremely simple. mRNA is altered so it can “cloak” and be allowed into your cell. Once in your cell, your ribosomes translate the mRNA into spike proteins. These spike proteins are displayed on the cellular membrane, and recognized by the immune system.

In the past “deactivated” pathogens were used, which either meant they couldn’t attach to your cells or they couldn’t replicate. But it took some time to identify compounds that would affect the pathogen in this way. So in the past, vaccines took years to develop.

Now we can sequence the DNA and have a working vaccine in a few months.

I would say that by giving the vaccine to first responders, the benefit is that you lower their risks, you lower their stress levels, you make it safer and thus more efficient to work with patients.

Normally a gene is transcribed from your DNA into a strand of mRNA that is then transported through the envelope of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it's used to synthesize a protein and is then destroyed. What the vaccine does is just introduce extra mRNA into the cytoplasm of a relatively small number of cells to produce a different protein. It doesn't go into the nucleus. It doesn't touch your DNA. It doesn't make permanent changes to how a cell operates. Like the ""normal"" mRNA, once it's produced that protein it's then destroyed.

To put it another way, just because you put pepper into the pork mix for your sausages it doesn't make the pig peppery.

What's particularly interesting here is the walking-back you've done from your initial claims of ""tells your DNA to make proteins it never has before"" to ""ok, it doesn't actually alter your DNA but it does rewrite cells"" to ""ok, it just produces viral proteins"".

Overall, the vaccine looks like it it safe and effective.

All vaccines have minot side effects. The intent is to stimulate you natural immune system, which causes symptoms we associate with feeling sick. Overall it looks like side effects, mostly fatigue and swelling, were **slighly** worse than the Pfizer vaccine. 

Among those who expereinced these minor side effects side effects they also lasted a little longer. With the Phizer vaccine, most symptms were gone by the second day after the injection (mostly second does), whereas the symptms last a couple of days with this one.

Long term effects are impossible to entirely rule out with 100% confidence. However, there is no reason to believe based on the biochemistry that one would experience any long-term effects. The mRNA, like all mRNA, simply gets your own genes to create proteins. In this case, it gets them to make the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry to your cells. Enough copies are made that your body recognizes it as being foreign and creates antibodies to attack it and ultimately the virus should you be exposed. 

This is the natural way that your body would recognize and attack any virus. The only difference is that the spike protein by itself cannot cause covid-19. Considering that your body makes about 90,000 different proteins, it is hard for me to see how an additional one, with the sole function of attaching to cells, could cause long-term harm, but this is fairly new--and in my opinon exciting--tech.",5,0.086,0.056,0.857,0.6705

–Big Pharma cannot tell you how long the alleged protection of COVID-19 vaccines will last.

–Big Pharma has zero data on young children’s response to their warp speed-produced jabs, even as schools across the globe prepare to mandate it as a condition of access to education.

–Big Pharma can’t tell you about the synergistic effects of the COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines.

–Nor can Big Pharma tell you about the long-term side effects of its “miraculous” shots. (And don’t forget the astonishing fact that vaccine makers are immune from lawsuits by vaccine-injured Americans.)

Here’s what we do know: The Pfizer clinical trial enrolled 43,538 participants, of whom 94 (about two-tenths of 1%) were identified as having COVID-19. The Moderna clinical trial included more than 30,000 participants, of whom 95 (about three-tenths of 1%) were categorized as having COVID-19. In other words: The vaccine is being tested on people who are at incredibly low risk of COVID-19 — not only the vaccinated enrollees but also the unvaccinated.


According to a highly critical article in the British Medical Journal, which reviewed the details of all the ongoing phase III COVID vaccine trials released to date, “laboratory confirmed infections even with only mild symptoms qualify as meeting the primary endpoint definition. In Pfizer and Moderna’s trials, for example, people with only a cough and positive laboratory test” qualify as COVID-19 positive cases. Astra Zeneca’s paused COVID-19 vaccine trial allowed a mere cough and fever with a positive PCR test to qualify as a positive case. Final efficacy analyses are planned after vaccine trial officials document a measly 150-160 “events” (positive indications of symptomatic COVID-19, regardless of illness severity).

The BMJ author, associate editor Peter Doshi, pointed out that none of the trials underway “are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths. Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.” This is in stark contrast to how the trials have been marketed to the public as assessing the vaccine’s impact on preventing severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalizations and deaths.

Moderna’s own chief medical officer told the BMJ that the company’s trial lacks adequate statistical power to assess severe COVID-19 outcomes. That’s because hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 “are simply too uncommon in the population being studied for an effective vaccine to demonstrate statistically significant differences in a trial of 30,000 people. The same is true of its ability to save lives or prevent transmission: the trials are not designed to find out.” Bottom line: COVID-19 is too rare and too benign to permit analysis of exactly the kind of serious health outcomes that most Americans believe the vaccine will “cure.”

Vaccinating billions of people to prevent a disease with a 99% + survival rate for people under 70 — all based on clinical trial efficacy analysis of less than 200 COVID-19 cases involving patients with coughs and unreliable PCR tests with significant false positive rates — is not the triumph of science. It’s corruption and it’s the tip of the iceberg.

What this means in practice, we need to continue to mask and socially distance until we know more or until infection rates are low enough. 

Even if transmission is only reduced by 60% (as the current evidence from the Moderna vaccine suggests), the decreasing number of people who end up in the hospital or ICU from COVID will be very beneficial.

Yes of course, TCJA restructured taxes so that people end up paying more taxes in 2021 than they did before it was signed in 2017, especially for people in California/NY. Companies pay less, and that slack was picked up by personal taxes.

>You do know the house and senate create the laws, not the president. The president is only meant to enforce them.....

Well, actually the president isn't meant to enforce them. He's nominally meant to be there for foreign matters, not domestic ones. Anyway, we all know the president gets blamed for whatever happens - just look at three quarters of Obama's presidency being under a completely hostile Republican congress, and somehow everything bad was still blamed on Obama.

>The only thing I see coming is Biden slapping restrictions on companies that Trump removed from such as coal electric facilities.

Which will actually save most people money in the long run. We as a society have to pay for the coal that is being burned, but the price isn't included in the price of buying the coal. The restrictions will actually reduce your taxes in the long run, they actually reduce the amount your taxes are subsidising outdated coal companies that would have already failed if the market was efficient in pricing coal to all of its costs.

It's funny that you say ""Oh it's Congress, not Trump, that is writing these laws"" but then turn around and blame Biden. Hypocrite much?

>Shutting down Fracking will increase gas prices.

Shutting down fracking will reduce the cost to the tax payer, don't you understand that you're paying for the clean up of those fracking practices? You're subsidising the gas price when the environmental cleanup costs of fracking aren't included in the gas price. That's why they're cheaper - I work in the industry and I make big bucks from gas prices being so cheap. I get a slice of that pie by way of bonus, but most people don't and I think it's unfair that your taxes are paying for my bonus.

>Pushing us into Frances carbon credit deal, still curious it's been 4 years. Guess it can't work unless America signs since we will be the only one having to pay since Trump stopped paying 80% of the UN cost.

The world's\*\* carbon credit deal. The Paris Agreement was an adaption of the Kyoto Protocol, and every developed nation on the planet signed it except the US, who only didn't because they're the worst offenders of over pollution per capita. The US produce 15% of the world's pollution but have less than 5% of the world's population - on average US citizens pollute more than **three times** the world average. That's sickening. If every country polluted as much as the US does then we'd already have had an apocalypse. You think the US is doing so great? That people want to live there? Fuck no, the US is subsidised by Europe massively. Kids 50 years ago in Europe used to grow up wanting to live in the US, nowadays kids in Europe laugh at the US as if it's a third world country.

>Still never seen where this carbon credit money will go.

Then you're willfully ignorant, because it's been said time and time and time again that it will go into reducing the tax burden of the environmental cleanup that polluting requires. The tax credit is a simple market solution of shifting the cost of the cleanup from you onto the companies that are profiting from burning coal. It's increasing the efficiency of the market.

>You might just lose, the news will blame Trump no matter what bad thing it is. Just like they gave trumps accomplishments to obama.

The news doesn't do one thing, so stop pretending to be a martyr. There's a whole spread of news that covers the whole political ideology. Fox News absolutely never gave credit to Obama for what Trump did. The fact of the matter is that consequences of the decisions presidents make come into fruition in the next president's term very often. Trump was at the helm when the vaccine was developed, but we won't see the effects until Biden is president. Trump was at the helm when the tax hikes were signed into law, but we won't see the effects until Biden is president. Just remember that when you think Biden has increased your taxes - he hasn't and he won't, he's more in favour of lower taxes than Trump is. Biden is a liberal, not a progressive, he prefers lower taxes, lower than Trump prefers in fact. Trump is less free market capitalist than Biden is, that's part of why Biden is so liberal and the left don't really like him.

I'm really not sure if that is the point you are trying to make, because you didn't say much. I'll assume that is what you are trying to say.

Trump has a vaccine approved from two companies (Pfizer and Moderna). Pfizer is a huge company and didn't need federal investment to fund the R&D for their vaccine, Moderna is small and has received millions.  **Operation Warp Speed is much more than paying companies to develop a vaccine.** If subsidizing a vaccine was all there was to operation warp speed, I would not think it was much of an accomplishment for Trump (even democrats can spend money...)

Operation warp speed took the FDA approval process which usually takes years for a new vaccine and overlaid the steps on top of one another to make it only take a few months.  Trump was able to get a the bureaucracy to change from how it normally operations to get the vaccines approved in a few months instead of years. 

The other reason Pfizer has millions of doses are because the federal government, as part of operation warp speed, ordered millions of doses before Pfizer had approval or even knew how effective their vaccine was.  That made it much less risky for Pfizer to start stockpiling their vaccine. The same thing happened for Moderna.

gggd41h,2020-12-19,"Same result, different delivery method. 

In previous vaccines, an inactivated pathogen was created. Usually this meant the pathogen could either no longer replicate, or no longer bind to our cells. So this free floating pathogen that cant hurt you is then digested normally by phagocytes, and it’s antigens are then displayed to your adaptive immune system (t cells). 

In this vaccine mRNA, or *messenger* RNA, is introduced directly. This carries the set of instructions to create the spike proteins (those little red arms) of covid 19. 

This is how viruses normally replicate, and create more of themselves: with *your* cells. But the key is that you are only introducing instructions for the harmless spike protein, nothing else.

Once your cells create this protein, your body recognizes that spike protein isn’t supposed to be there and carries it back via phagocyte to be displayed in the same way.

ggkgpmj,2020-12-20,"Thanks for asking respectfully. Not at all skeptical of normal vaccines. They have been tested and used for a very long time. All my kids have been vaccinated.

I just have no clue what the vaccine is capable of. They truly dont either. They said they will be doing research on populations for years who took this vaccine. We cannot deny this is fast tracked science and they dont have the proper data. I'm not worried about taking it and killing over instantly. I'm more worried about something longterm. Autoimmune perhaps. I just want to see what happens with it. This body is the only one I got.

  I also find it strange we have diseases that kill more people per year than Covid but we were never worried about that. We never fast tracked anything for those people. Cancer kills 700k in the US per year but we didnt walk around wearing masks because they were immunocompromised and we ALL know someone who has had or died of cancer. We cant say the same for Covid. It's just all weird to me that we werent publicly health conscious of others prior but now we all running around fearmongering and acting like capt save a hoe with our face diapers over something with a 99.6% survival rate. It's a joke. Covid is very real but we cannot deny it is now being used as a tool to control us now.

Notice the CDC or media isnt recommending to lose weight, take zinc and D to help. They all denied hydroclorquine does anything when we have proof it works against Covid. Instead, its wear masks, dont see your family,lose your job, lockdowns and mandatory vaccine for certain people already. Oh but we arent going to help you with any money to save your home. Here's 1200 for 9 months tho. Make it work. It is downright sinister.

I have to ponder why all this is. Only thing that comes to mind is conditioning society. They dont care about you or your grandmas life. They care about money and political power. They are tearing apart our livelihoods for their corporate lobbyists. They cant have you under their thumb if you dont have something to fear.

But trust the vaccine and everything these people say and save lives right? Naw. I'd rather get back to work and keep living mine because just as before 2020, society didnt collapse because people died. This is blown way tf outta proportion. I won't buy into it.

These lifeless proteins have zero capacity for harming our bodies but do something remarkable: The proteins fool our bodies into thinking that it's under attack by a virus and consequently invoke an immune response. When our bodies produce an immune response to a pathogen (or to proteins surrounding a pathogen) it can result in immunity to the virus. That's a vaccine. (Or one type of vaccine)

The initial recommendation of 3-4 weeks between 1st and 2nd dose is due to the protocol followed by the study. The reason why the CDC extended this guideline to 6 weeks is likely due to logistical issues related to supply and administration of vaccine. 

Although there is no data to support 6 weeks, I imagine they extrapolated due to the fact that most 2nd doses of other vaccines are provided 1 month after the first. Is there data to support this? No. But did they weigh the pros and cons of this recommendation, I'm sure they did.

No. We got this done quickly because there was years of research of coming up with a vaccine for SARS-COVID-1, Wuflu's close brother. Problem with all that research is that while the vaccine worked in preventing SARS-COVID-1, it also had a tendency to kill the recipient (Cardiopulmonary failure IIR the papers correctly).

Since you don't seem to understand how rushing a regulatory process reduces the quality of it, consider this: Regulation is not the only factor which assures product safety. 

The business landscape does as well. Lawsuits create negative profit for impure or unsafe processes adding selection to the competition landscape. Every pharmaceutical company has a legal team in charge of calculating if the company can afford an expected number of lawsuits. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization is not just a list of ways the regulatory process could be rolled back for expediency, it is also a legal shield in court. They weren't neglectful, they were expediting the production of a vaccine to address an emergency pandemic situation. This will reduce both the number and the average cost of settlements and court-awarded sums.

Companies who sacrificed speed for effectiveness may have been the ones to make it to market. Those who sacrificed speed for safety and purity are less likely to have been the ones to deploy. Those who get sued will likely still make a killing, and they know it.

There are no past mass-production processes of mRNA vaccines to fall back on. No previously approved written processes or SOPs to reference except where they've been jumbled and shaken into an unfamiliar place in a production pipeline. These manufacturing companies did all of this FROM SCRATCH in a very narrow time frame, with an expedited regulatory process and in a competitive landscape which is unprecedented at it's current scale and with current technology.

Safety is not binary. Things are not 'Safe' or 'Dangerous' Everything is risk-management. All I'm saying is that it is reasonable to acknowledge the huge unknowns that this untested production landscape has created. The decision to take this particular vaccine is not as cut and dry as people who would like to lump the reluctant with anti-vaxxers would like people to believe.

One of the go-to spaces were empty department stores in malls.   Because malls have open, unrented space - awesome accessibility and easy parking (remember - elderly), and an empty department store has TONS of room, is under AC/Heat, is clean - and they're common - and the landlords were happy to donate the space for FREE.  It has worked out wonderfully.  I took my elderly neighbor in as she can't drive - that was early on and they had their shit TOGETHER.  The line was socially distanced, masks were of course requires and they had free masks outside the entrance to the store if folks forgot.  The line looked miserably long, but as it was super staffed it moved at times faster than old folks using walkers could move.  They had staff with tablets checking in folks as they were in line - so as to not create a potential bottleneck. 

But wait!  There's more!  At the same time we rolled out vaccination centers at supermarkets and Walgreens/CVS stores.   And would ya guess what?  Even poor neighborhoods have a CVS and/or a Walgreens.  I just looked and the worst/poorest neighborhood I k ow of in my area has two Walgreens,. CVS, and a Publix - all of which are vaccination centers.  

Oh, and their contingency for unused doses at the end of the day is that of genius.  Come near the end of the day they look at how many doses they have.  And hit the telephones.  We already have a system in place to vaccinate home-bound seniors, and home-bound seniors are generally AT HOME and easy to reach.  So they decide they'll have (made up #) 50 doses that'd be unused/wasted.  They then start to call folks with appts for in home vaccinations a few days out - and say ""Hi- we have unused vials - would you be available this afternoon/evening to get yours early? "" Then they'd roll paramedics and nurses to those folks and use up what would otherwise be unused doses.

about vaccines mostly being sent by population but also maybe supplementing
those that aren’t doing as well. Is there also supplementation for those that

elderly African-American residents.

priorities. Right. We know that our 65 and over population is absolutely

gpmbn2t,2021-03-03,"I think it is less fair to prioritize vaccines based on race, which implicates mostly socioeconomic and cultural factors, than to look solely at absolute medical risk.

One of the reasons black people die, on average, at a higher rate from COVID is that they seek medical treatment later.  This stems from, e.g, that population's mistrust of the medical system.

However, if you take a black person and white person, and put them in the same hospital at the same time, there will on average be a statistically insignificant difference in their health outcomes.

***Moreover, including race as a metric necessitates ""double counting"" of underlying conditions.***  The biggest reason reason POC die at a higher rate from COVID is that, on average, they have worse underlying conditions than white people.  For example, black people suffer from significantly higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, all of which we know increases COVID mortality and the severity of COVID symptoms and sequelae.

Here's the problem: vaccines already prioritize people on the basis of underlying conditions and age.  Including race as a factor in vaccine priority causes a lot of problematic overlap.  **In other words, by including co-morbidities (e.g., obesity, asthma, diabetes, etc.) in vaccine priorities, we are already accounting for most of the racial disparity of the virus.**  Further including skin color as a category is excessive, lazy, and arbitrary.

Finally, introducing socioeconomic factors, rather than pure medical factors, into the equation, makes principled line-drawing quite difficult.  There's rural versus urban differences in health outcomes from COVID.  There's also a difference in health outcomes based on household income, irrespective of race.  Shouldn't these also be included in the vaccine priority calculation then?  How about the quality of local doctors and hospitals?  How about certain religious sects which are more skeptical of traditional medicine?  There's a plethora of socioeconomic factors affecting virus outcomes, yet only race is included as a vaccine metric.

Keep in mind that over 92 million doses of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 had been injected, with 1,637 deaths occurring following the injections. Those 1,600 deaths may have had absolutely nothing to do with getting vaccinated considering that vaccines are mostly being given to the elderly who may have a number of underlying health conditions to begin with. Let's assume for argument's sake that 92 million injections = 46 million people vaccinated (the number of people vaccinated is higher considering that some people have only received one dose so far, but to keep it simple, I just assumed that 46 million received both doses = 92 million total injections). That means that there were 1,637 deaths that happened around the time of vaccination out of 46 million people. That means that 0.0036% of people that were vaccinated died around the time of being vaccinated. You'll have to take that risk assessment into account when determining if you want the vaccine. You have 3 options:

1. Get the vaccine

2. Get the virus

3. Hope that society reaches herd immunity (either from infection and recovery or death from the virus or from people getting vaccinated), and the virus goes away before you have to either get vaccinated or get the virus; there is no guarantee that this strategy will work because you can't guarantee that you can avoid the virus while everyone else pushes us towards herd immunity.

So what's your risk assessment? Get the vaccine where 0.0036% of people have died around the time of getting vaccinated (keep in mind that those deaths may have had nothing to do with the vaccine but could be coincidental), or risk getting the virus with a higher death rate than that 0.0036% along with the other potential health consequences that could impact you from infection? I know my risk assessment. I'm getting my second dose of vaccine tomorrow.

Also, by risking infection, you're also risking further spread to others whereas vaccinated individuals are very unlikely to spread it to someone else.

Long story short congress approves these budgets. Obama supported it as it moved to HHS. Trump with the GOP majority in 2016 expanded its scope and budget and also moved vaccine response out of FDA/CDC  and to a dedicated agency at the recommedation of experts. A very wise move. This was all pre-Covid.

Warp speed is a partnership with businesses. Both the business that create vaccines and manufacturing companies that committed to create tests, PPE and vaccines in our time of need. For the most part in a year we got 3-4 effective vaccines, we are cranking out 10's of millions of vaccines and after a short lag we mass produced PPE and COVID test in amazing numbers.

“ For the primary efficacy endpoint, the case definition for a confirmed COVID-19 case was the presence of at least one of the following symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT within 4 days of the symptomatic period: Fever; New or increased cough; New or increased shortness of breath; Chills; New or increased muscle pain; New loss of taste or smell; Sore throat; Diarrhea; Vomiting.””

So Pfizer had 2 groups. 

Injection Group: 8/18,198 = 0.04%
Placebo Group: 162/18,325= 0.88%

That’s where the “95% efficacy” comes from 8/162

They are measuring one symptom. 

Based completely on the data supplied by the vaccine maker (conflict of interest) if you take the vaccine you have a 0.04% chance of having one symptom, if you don’t you have a 0.88% chance of having one symptom FOR A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS!

People think it’s a 95% probability that it will protect you from the virus. That’s not what they are measuring. 


Let’s not forget about 3,410 “suspected but unconfirmed” cases that were excluded from Pfizer’s results. 1,594 from the vaccinated group and 1,816 from the placebo group. Adding the 170 cases Pfizer used to get 95% efficacy to the suspected cases would mean, wait for it...

There was no global lockdown with H1N1, so if you think the Spanish flu isn't comparable, this isn't either. 

Your car mechanic analogy makes no sense. I personally don't know more about cars than a mechanic, so if a mechanic were to tell me not to drive my car, as it was not road safe, I would not drive it. I wouldn't say 'I know better, I'll take my chances' because if that car has an accident, it's not just me who is in danger. 

If a car mechanic said, ""Take this free repair which will make your car safe,"" I would take it in a second. Because a mechanic dedicates his life to knowing more than me about cars. 

>Does that mean you believe anything he says?

About cars? Yeah, or at the very least I value his professional opinion over my rudimentary understanding of cars. He spent years learning this stuff, I didn't.

But this analogy still doesn't really apply. Because this isn't just 1 mechanic, it's the entire world. To make this analogy truly apply, you would need millions of mechanics, around the world, explaining how driving your car will cause people to die. And if everyone just took a safe, FREE repair, they would be okay

* People with a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any vaccine or injectable (intramuscular or intravenous) medication should consult with their health provider to assess risk prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

*  Specific efficacy and safety data are not yet available for people with immunosuppression due to medications or chronic illness 
*  The current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were not studied or approved in children younger than 16 years of age.  
*  The extent to which antibodies that develop in response to COVID-19 infection are protective is still under study. If these antibodies are protective, it’s not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.  
*  you can be vaccinated four weeks after onset of symptoms or a positive test (whichever is earlier). For  Dose #2  you may be vaccinated after you have completed you isolation period.

gsqor9k,2021-03-29,">Where do you get this made up info from?

From my own life experiences and common knowledge lol

**School**: [Here](https://uhs.princeton.edu/medical-services/immunizations-allergy-shots/required-recommended-immunizations), [here](https://shs.osu.edu/vaccinations1/university-vaccination-requirement), and [here](https://www.depaul.edu/admission-and-aid/admitted/Pages/immunizations-requirements.aspx) are examples of vaccinations being required for school. There are hundreds more examples on Google if you are curious.

**Employment**: This [CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/vaccinationlaws.html) (and its branching links) point to a bunch of states that require vaccinations for employment in healthcare. I know from experience that many healthcare facilities--for example, UCLA Health, requires immunizations for all employees, even nonproviders like systems administrators.

Some examples:

>Maine law requires that “each Designated Healthcare Facility in the State of Maine shall require for all employees proof of immunization or documented immunity against

>[Illinois state law requires](https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization) certain immunizations for children and adults enrolled in child care, school, or college. **State law also mandates immunizations for adults in specific fields of work**

**Travel:** [From the CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-vaccines):

>A required vaccine is one that travelers must have in order to enter a country, based on that country’s government regulations. In most circumstances, yellow fever is the only vaccine required by certain countries

[More here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_requirements_for_international_travel#Meningococcal_meningitis):

For example:

>Countries with required meningococcal vaccination for travellers include The Gambia, Indonesia, Lebanon, Libya, the Philippines, and most importantly and extensively Saudi Arabia for Muslims visiting or working in Mecca and Medina during the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages.

**Sports:** [Here](https://www.nfhs.org/articles/athletics-eligibility-and-medical-vaccinations/) is some reading about immunizations required for organized sports. Of note, a court and appeals court ruled, citing an earlier SC decision, that the league is perfectly within its rights to require immunizations for participation:

>Kunkel’s family filed an appeal and on June 26, 2019, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision. In rejecting Jerome Kunkel’s arguments that because of the actions of the NKHD, he didn’t get to play in the state tournament, a basketball all-star game, and benefit from the related exposure to college scouts, the Court of Appeals quoted the U.S. Supreme Court’s statement in the Jacobsen case that “Of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.”

Correct. However, the overall data still show that you're not likely to have any complications from the vaccine, and you're far less likely to have any vaccine complications than complications from the virus. Both are exceedingly rare for a young age group, but the vaccine still has better numbers.

>Common sense tells me that a ""rushed"" non-FDA approved mRNA vaccine that commands certain things to happen in the cells of your body, PERMANENTLY..., without knowing or having any ""DATA"" on the long term effects of such, is a gamble that I see absolutely ZERO reason to take.

This is kind of a half-truth. The FDA authorized emergency use of the vaccine, so in a way, it is FDA approved. The vaccine also underwent all phases of a standard FDA approval process through phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, and it's currently in stage 4 market surveillance, which is the standard for any medical treatment. All of that information and data are publicly available:

https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389



The vaccine's mechanism is something that your body already does. In fact it's the exact same mechanism that your immune system does when in contact with the virus just without the actual viral infection. It provides a piece of messenger RNA (mRNA) for the ribosomes in your cells to build what's called the spike protein. The spike protein is on the surface of the coronavirus. This allows your immune cells to recognize the spike protein on the coronavirus and kill it. Your cells do the same thing when in contact with the virus. It will build a spike protein to show to your immune cells, and it trains your immune cells to kill it.

>These types of vaccines, the type that change the way cells in the body operate, PERMANENTLY, will also biologically be passed down through GENERATIONS of your offspring and theirs forever in your family tree.

This is false. The vaccine has no effect on sperm or egg cells. It simply builds a protein for your t-cells and b-cells to recognize, and they can then kill the virus. If it doesn't change sperm or egg cells, then it can't be passed down to offspring. If that were the case, then you would be able to pass down immunity for the virus after infection to your children. You would also be able to pass down immunity for every other bug to your children, yet just because I'm vaccinated for Hepatitis B does not mean that my children will be too. My children will still need a Hepatitis vaccine.

>If you trust humans, let alone the profiteers (because no one has ever done something bad in the name of money right!?) , with the entire genealogy of your family tree's existence, forever, on a ""revolutionary"" type of vaccine that has absolutely ZERO DATA ON IT'S LONG TERM EFFECTS, let alone it essentially giving orders to do stuff to your DNA, FOREVER, all for a virus that has, essentially, a 99.999% survival rate (to someone like me), then, I guess the only thing I can say, is that's your choice.

Again, the vaccine does nothing to your DNA. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines give your cells a piece of RNA, not DNA, and it cannot go into your DNA. The J&J vaccine uses the DNA from and adenovirus to do the same thing by making RNA from the adenovirus DNA template, but again, it does not alter your DNA. 

Additionally, even if it did what you said it does (it does not), it would have to alter your sperm or egg cells (which it most certainly does not) in order to pass it to your children. Your sperm or egg cells don't have the capability to make these proteins or have a response to either the vaccine or the virus. The concerns about your future offspring are unfounded.

Also, regardless of your age group, you are far more likely to survive the vaccine than you are the virus. There have been zero deaths that can be attributed to vaccination so far. Does that mean you're likely to die from the virus? No. Let's say 10 people in one million die from the virus while 0 people in one million die from the vaccine in your age group. In both cases, you're very unlikely to die, but you are far more likely to die form the virus.

>I've also been deployed (16 countries and counting).., and grew up on a large farm (livestock / grain). I'm sure I've seen every type of bacteria and nastiness there is before I was even 10 years old (scooping hog shit for over 5000 hogs as a child is fun!).. And it's probably why my immune system is very good. I don't get sick, nor take medicine.., ever.

That's likely true. You've probably encountered a lot, and your immune system probably recognizes a lot of different bugs. You know another reason why your immune system recognizes a lot of bugs? You've been vaccinated. I've deployed several times too. Remember at boot camp when they put a bunch of needles in your ass? Vaccines. Remember when they stuck your arm a bunch of times before your first deployment? Vaccines. Remember when they took that little fork and poked you a bunch of times, and then you had this scab that you couldn't touch until it fell off 4-6 weeks (in my case 8 weeks) later? Smallpox vaccine. My immune system is strong too. Thank you, science!

>So as much as some people want to label people like me ""crazy"" or ""irresponsible"", I firmly believe my ""common sense"" to this whole ordeal and the reasons why, FAAAAAAAR outweigh it. MANY people share the same sentiment. Who could blame them?

I don't think you're crazy. I do think that your reasoning is flawed, but you're a grown-up, and you can make grown-up decisions. If you don't want the vaccine, then fine. I already had it, and so has my family. We're good to go. If you think the risk of infection is less than the risk of vaccination despite all available data, then that's your choice. The only way it could impact me is in the very rare instance that you might have to come to my hospital, so I have to treat you for the infection; that's my job, so no skin off my back really.",5,0.087,0.085,0.829,-0.9185

If that's the case, and it's a choice to become sick, so be it. Where it gets iffy is exposure to people who may have not yet had the opportunity to receive a vaccine even if they want one.

1.) The human immune system is more effective at killing covid than the vaccines.

According to CDC, 99% human survival rate vs 95% efficacy for vaccine (requiring multiple doses and possible side effects) So taking the vaccine after you have gotten covid or in fear of getting covid is not necessary.

2.) Masks have not proven to effect or impact lower case counts and deaths as we see CA and NY (strict mask mandate states) have had the same or higher case count per capita as TX and FL with similar population size over the span of a year according to NBC reporting.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-deaths-u-s-map-shows-number-fatalities-compared-confirmed-n1166966

3.) “Slow the spread” was entirely based on pro-longing the infection time phase, instead of allowing a sharp rise and fall in cases which would provide quicker here immunity and less time for the virus to adapt. Again, the entire “reason” was because “hospitals might overflow” I remember it very clearly.

4.) Lockdown inefficiency, along with mask wearing , have not proven to “kill off” the virus either. Since non lockdown states have had similar or better case counts compared to lockdown states, the only result to come from lockdowns was a destroyed small business economy.

5.) open states have been doing well in case counts, and even CA is allowing indoor dining again. Covid isnt “gone” so they wouldnt be opening up if they still thought a lockdown or mandates were working to “kill it all off before it mutates”. 

No, its better we all get it at once and beat in a quick sharp rise, not overflowing hospitals, with a 99% survival rate immune system to build quick herd immunity and not allow it to mutate as democrats have been doing every move in the book to make this virus stay and mutate by “slowing” anything with this virus.",1,0.065,0.049,0.886,0.6693

>You’ve got it twice in a year. what more evidence do you need that you can continue to spread it?

And a vaccine would change that how? You realize that there are different strains right? You realize that a vaccine against a single strain doesn't protect you from getting a second strain right? That's why the flu vaccine is woefully ineffective, because it only targets some of the strains each year and it's barely 50% effective if that.

“The EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) process is different than FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard may permit authorization based on significantly less data than would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA.

You're also getting stuck on the wrong thing - the issue at hand isn't specifically felon rights, it's constitutional rights period.

The Constitution does not specifically grant ""the right to vote"", but it specifically restricts the government from preventing you from voting for certain reasons.  The reasons make it difficult to imagine a scenario that would legally allow for the restriction of voting, especially with recent SC rulings, but the point is ""the right to vote"" is not granted from the Constitution - it only protects states from discriminating against you while trying to vote.

Now, again, as I've pointed out, everyone in the US currently *does* have the right to vote due to state laws, but that does not mean it was granted to them by the Constitution.

AND there is even an amendment that allows for the reduction in voting population, BUT that if a state were to do that, the number of electors for that state would be reduced proportionally.

Hopefully that will clear some things up for you.  Voting is definitely **A** right, but it is not a Constitutional right and under *federal* law could theoretically be legally taken away, though that would never happen.

The person I originally responded to claimed that ID for voting was worse than vaccine passports because ID for voting inhibits a Constitutional right, while requiring a vaccine passport would not inhibit that.

My coworker got it about a month and a half ago and he still feels like his head is cloudy. This is a pretty smart guy too and is fairly healthy.

Masks inhibit the spread of any infectious respiratory disease that travel via water particles. This is a proven fact. Mask mandates in certain places like high population densities greatly slowed the spread in those areas, and that was needed to keep the hospital beds from being overcapacity.

Some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines children receive, but studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing ASD. In 2011, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) reportexternal icon on eight vaccines given to children and adults found that with rare exceptions, these vaccines are very safe.

A 2013 CDC study [PDF – 7 pages]external icon added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body’s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD.

Vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.
One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004 scientific reviewexternal icon by the IOM concluded that “the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and autism.” Since 2003, there have been nine CDC-funded or conducted studies pdf icon[PDF – 2 pages] that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children.

Between 1999 and 2001, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for some flu vaccines. This was done as part of a broader national effort to reduce all types of mercury exposure in children before studies were conducted that determined that thimerosal was not harmful. It was done as a precaution. Currently, the only childhood vaccines that contain thimerosal are flu vaccines packaged in multidose vials. Thimerosal-free alternatives are also available for flu vaccine. For more information, see the Timeline for Thimerosal in Vaccines.

Besides thimerosal, some people have had concerns about other vaccine ingredients in relation to ASD as well. However, no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.",3,0.053,0.067,0.88,-0.8206

I used to try to explain stuff to people on this subreddit, but they refuse to accept any answer.  They have decided to drink the kool aid and are not willing to process new information.

1.  You are not 99.9% safe.  For all comers, it’s 2% death rate.  Much higher if you’re over 60.  But that’s only DEATH.  There is a much much higher percent of people who end up in the hospital for weeks, resulting in big hospital bills and loss of weeks of income.  The symptoms of Covid like shortness of breath and kidney injury can last months and can be permanent.   You ever seen somebody gasping for air or on a ventilator?  It is VERY uncomfortable and scary.  Worlds toughest acting guys are scared shitless.  It is not fun. 

2.  The vaccine is completely safe.  ESPECIALLY in comparison to Covid.  There have been no deaths after the vaccine that can be attributed to the vaccine.  We’ve given like 150 million doses or so, not sure where we are at.  Reported deaths in the time after the vaccine are ~1500.  Remember we gave it to all the sick nursing home people first.  It is likely for all these the deaths were from other causes and just happened to be in the short time after giving the vaccine.  This is opposed to 550,000 deaths from Covid.  We have vaccinated more people than have had Covid now.  

3.  And most importantly.  You can get Covid and spread it to people who it may cause very real problems for.  Like grandma or whoever.  Even if they have been vaccinated, they still run a very small chance of getting it.  Or there are people who cannot get the vaccine because of allergies or immune disorders.  Not being immunized allows this disease to live in pockets of the non immunized and be passed around and creat new variants that our vaccine potentially doesn’t work against.

4.  Getting Covid appears to have short lived immunity compared to the vaccine.  At 6 mos (that’s how long it’s been since first people got it) those who received Covid vaccine still have good antibodies to it,  this is in contrast to people who actually got Covid, of which 75%ish do not have sustained immunity.  

I hope this clears it up.  I have sources for anything I’ve said here.  Im a physician and have been following Covid closely.  

I would recommend you take part in arguably the greatest accomplishment in man kind and in science.  1 year to stop a massive pandemic.  If Covid were allowed to play out on its own, we would expect around 6 million deaths in America alone.",3,0.107,0.118,0.776,-0.8476

The Spanish flu of the 1918 did not have a vaccine and once wasn't even available until about 1950 yet it only lasted one year which actually supports my argument more than it does yours. and it affected so many because of a number of factors involved, low hygiene, war, low health care, stress, malnutrition, mass travel, intermingling for the first time on a mass scale.

Your argument about the mutation of the virus etc is faulty because as of right now the information put out is far too politicized and is highly in question. Look at the total death count of the globe year after year and look at it now. It's on par.

Other cultures are irrelevant, I'm asking you why you don't wear a mask every flu season, don't you care about the \~36 M global deaths for the seasonal flu? 

There is no emotional argument to be made here, there is no scientific argument to be made here to mandate a vaccine.

Fed power, even from a very conservative standpoint(one step left of libertarian), is perfect for situations like emergency vaccine rollouts, disaster relief, and wartime, where a federal response is needed because it is faster and more organized than 50 individual responses. For general policy and local emergencies sure, states first. That slow, organic, conservative development is what makes solid policy, and local emergencies can usually be handled locally, maybe with a little federal aid. For national security issues where time and clarity are key, the fed makes a million times more sense.

Furthermore, for anyone who immigrates to this country, their vaccination records are required. If they don’t have the standard US vaccines that an adult is expected to have received, they’re caught up on their vaccines before they’re allowed to travel here. 

Adding to that, even the most liberal states (NY and CA) have recently taken action to ensure that parents cannot opt their children out of the required pediatric vaccinations due to things like religious freedom.  The overwhelming majority of school systems across the country require children to have a certain set of vaccines prior to entering kindergarten or by the age of 4, whatever comes first.

I think he's doing it again and the media is enabling him no doubt if they're not complicit in the cover up actively, which I believe they are.

 Conversely, Donald Trump acted within a month of having the most information he could possibly obtain on the COVID-19 at the time. At this point, who really knows what the truth is? I am making an exception for the liberal media who, again, knows exactly what Biden and his cronies are doing and they're covering up for said politicians.

That is to say that I don't think we really know the whole truth about vaccines for the COVID-19 virus and how to respond to what's going on in the medical field at this point. 

I believe that the media and certain political figures are doing worse than that to be honest. That they are creating panic to any degree for profit and power by giving the American people cause to wonder if medical, scientific, and media professionals have no idea what they're doing and may not care or, worse, are conspiring actively with certain other individuals and groups to hide the truth is concerning at best.

I just dont understand what you are trying to say at this point. The population on a whole has higher mortality from covid than the flu.

>So, in short, we don't know if this vaccine is safe, but we're going to pump it into children anyways.

Well, we do know that in the short-term, it's safe for the population it was tested on, and there have been exceedingly few adverse vaccine reactions reported; that, combined with the fact that kids and young adults are not at a particularly high risk of serious infection is why we used it on adults first. We tested on people from ages ranged 18-95, so that's who we used it on.

Moreover, how exactly does Paluska recommend that we conduct vaccine trials on children? How do you develop a vaccine trial to test the safety on children without using the vaccine on children? That's why you start with a small number of children (a few hundred to a few thousand), evaluate the data, then expand it once it has been deemed safe; that's literally the process for any novel treatment. This man is clearly ignorant of drug development processes.

Paluska then goes on to lament the demographic disparities between vaccine trial participants and the general population even though no racial considerations are even particularly relevant.

>The fact of the matter is, you probably don't know if it's safe for children, just like you probably didn't know if it was safe for adults.

No. We know that it's safe for adults. Those data are publicly available. Some vaccines are not suitable for younger children and pregnant women (i.e. mmr), so we don't give it to them. It's unlikely that this mRNA vaccine would be unsafe for either based on its mechanism, but Fauci is being overly-cautious in his language as usual (what I dislike about him).

>That's likely why the FDA never actually approved the vaccine but only approve its emergency use and why you said we need to test it on a ""normal"" population to see if it's safe or not.

No. A typical FDA approval process takes 10 years on average. The vaccines went through phase 1,2, and 3 clinical trials, and is currently in phase 4 market surveillance and have demonstrated an effective safety profile on those tested; that's the same with every other novel treatment. We didn't have 10 years, but we still put it through the typical channels for monitoring safety.

Yes there are side effects and risks associated with any medicine, including OTC pain, cold, and allergy medication.

Whether an actual piece of paper or something on an app, I’m assuming there’s a central repository of information which can be referenced, proving the person with the vaccine passport is who they say they are.  Which would be necessary.


It’s like a gym membership tag.  If someone found one on the street, they could use it to enter a gym and use the equipment right up until someone asked them to verify who they were.  Then they’d have to match the information the gym has on file.  Just like a driver’s license or state ID works.  If queried, there is a system that can verify your ID information.  The gym keeps the data for the gym membership and the state keeps the data for the state ID.


This means to verify the person bearing the vaccine passport is who they say they are and they aren’t just borrowing a friend’s vaccine passport, it has to be tied to a state-level ID somewhere, or the person stopped on the street would have to produce some form of ID... I assume?


So, if implemented, you’ll perhaps need a vaccine passport to... enter bars and restaurants?  Shop in public places?  Go other places in public?  Okay.  How about be in public while voting?  Is this... a voter ID?",16,0.033,0.008,0.959,0.7149

[Source](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/vaccinations.html)

If you don't have them and don't have a good reason not to have them (e.g. it being life threatening if you get them, being pregnant, etc), then you either have to get them, or you're denied entry.

Other countries have similar vaccination requirements when traveling to them, however when going from a country like the US with high levels of vaccination/herd immunity, it's frequently not checked because most of those diseases are actively being spread. Covid is actively being spread in the US.

But go to, say, some countries in Africa, for instance, they will stringently check your vaccination records as well for things like MMR, yellow fever, etc. in order to go there because those diseases are not well contained and actively spreading and they don't want immigrants contributing to the outbreak.

Now, there's already a [covid vaccine passport](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/passport-covid-19.html) - which you can apply for. To me this seems to have no downside? If you don't want one, and don't want to go somewhere that requires a covid vaccine, then don't get one?

But like, if a country is requiring one for you to enter, it makes sense that someone who wants to get one would want to get one, no?

That's what the passport is for. If people want to set up requirements for proof of vaccination in order for you to enter, I suppose that's their personal/sovereign right, no?

Or at least something on the state level. But there isn’t-  and the fact that there isn’t is actually legislated.  For 200 years, liberals and conservatives alike have both agreed that America should be the land of the free and that the government shouldn’t require a national ID. THAT is why ids can’t constitutionally be required for voting (again, to be clear, I feel there should be such an ID and it should be required to vote- Edit: as an aside, what better way to determine if somebody is legal or illegal than showing their national ID card?- the system seems to work pretty well in every other country in the world), but the US is a country that has it baked into law that there cannot be such a mandatory government ID card.

But there are loads of voluntary government IDs, drivers licenses, passports, library card, hunting license, fishing permit, business license, even a SIN is technically voluntary, etc etc.  And there are loads of activities that are restricted to people who hold those IDs. A vaccine passport would be no different.  Nobody has to get one- it would be voluntary. But if you don’t have one you can’t do certain things- certain things like shopping that aren’t guaranteed to you like your right to vote is guaranteed.
If you truly think that that is analogous to requiring ID to vote, you’re simply a moron, so I really hope you only wrote that to get some upvotes.

The voting question is clear cut- either voting ID must be required (again, this is my position) but then the government must require and provide that ID,  or - as is currently the case - if it doesn’t require people to have a mandatory ID and it doesn’t provide them, then it’s unconstitutional to ask for it during the voting process.",6,0.132,0.062,0.806,0.9724

gt5l8op,2021-04-02,"Yes, partially. With time I have no issue with a country requiring proof at ports of entry that a person has been vaccinated. Countries all over the world already do it. 

My concern is what happens *within* a country. A business requiring proof of vaccination to participate is not something that has ever been done before and carries some scary ramifications. 

Take a baseball game for example (since the season just started and I love baseball), say somebody for whatever reason decides that do not wish to be vaccinated or is a minority who has been unable to be vaccinated. That person wants to go to a baseball game. That person is asked to provide proof of vaccination and being unable to do so they are turned away. Now say that person did not want to be vaccinated because of a religious reason. Or again say being a minority made it difficult for whatever reason. The argument could be made this is a civil rights act violation because you’re discriminating against them for a religious view or because they’re a minority. 

Now let’s say to avoid the hassle of all that ballparks say you can come in with either a mask if you’re unvaccinated or with proof of vaccination in your passport. So now our individual is inside the ballpark. Thousands of people walking around masked (unvaccinated) and maskless (the vaccinated). How do you prevent this individual from just slipping off their mask and blending in as a vaccinated individual? You could stop and check people’s passports. But that’s a scary thought of being randomly stopped and asked “your papers please.” How do you know you weren’t just profiled because of your race. After all, you *are* a minority and minorities (so far) are less likely to be vaccinated. Or maybe it was your religious garb that gave you away. Either way. They’re having to pick people out based on *something* 

So the next solution is to just say regardless of vaccination status everyone has to be masked while at the game. If that’s the case, what’s the point of having the vaccine passport? Why did I even get a vaccine if potentially for the rest of my life I have to worry about wearing a mask because someone didn’t get the vaccine. There’s people who don’t get a polio vaccine. I don’t wear a mask for fear of getting polio because *I’m vaccinated*

gt5rgqz,2021-04-02,"Agreed that we should focus on within the country, because regardless of how fair or unfair you or someone views something, another country does not need to bow to cries or screams of American Civil Liberties. They do not need to let you in, regardless of reason - vaccine or otherwise. It is a dead in the water argument.

For your in-country baseball example, the entire premise is based on the assumption that masked, unvaccinated people would be let in too. I don't see that assumption being true (due to the exact flaw you pointed out). The idea is that a vaccine passport (or proof of a negative test) would be the only things that let you in. In which case, it is factually, objectively solving the problem of viral spread.

In the end, you're overlooking the simple fact that a baseball stadium (or any private business or event) has their own right to refuse entry. And your attempt to shoehorn the vaccine refusal as some religious exemption is flawed (no major religion prohibits vaccines).

I also cry foul in regards to your claim about a minority missing a baseball game because they have a harder time getting a vaccine appointment. I lived in Baltimore for 10 years, working directly with minority and underprivileged youth and adults as part of my profession. There are enough services and safety nets that if someone is able to buy themselves a $15 ticket to a baseball game, they are just as able to walk themselves into a CVS minute clinic and get a free vaccine or a free covid test. (To be clear, I'm talking about at a future time when everyone is eligible and can readily get an appointment without being on a giant wait-list - which is when vaccine passport enforcement would begin.)

As a moderate, it's just mind boggling to watch the right call the left snowflakes (often warranted, I might add), but then basically scream ""my rights"" when simply told their decisions have consequences in regards to private businesses. No, you don't have a right to watch baseball in person or get a steak at your favorite steakhouse, if they believe you haven't done your due diligence to protect the other paying patrons that they want to have keep coming back.

The religious reasons I mentioned were for as pointed out below you, for certain vaccines not being kosher or being haram. It’s not a huge or likely issue (because there are multiple vaccines from different manufacturers and labs) but it could still happen. 

To your point about passport enforcement not being until a point in the future when it’s readily available to anyone who wants it, I would ask, “what’s the point of the passport if everyone is vaccinated?” 

We never had people carry around vaccine records to go to a large event before. People who are vaccinated with something like a TDaP don’t have to worry about someone who isn’t vaccinated. So why do people with Covid vaccines have to worry about someone who isn’t vaccinated?

It just doesn’t make sense in my mind why a passport would even be necessary when we reach the point that the vast majority of people are vaccinated. 

I agree about your point that someone who can afford a $15 ticket can get a vaccine if they want. As you mention though it depends on time. As it currently stands, we’re getting better, but underprivileged and minority communities are lagging behind in vaccination rates.

I'll be honest, I didn't know about the pork thing with certain vaccines. But like you said, there seems to be enough options available that are made a different way.

The reason I think the passport can help, is that there is a big difference between everyone having easy access to the free vaccine vs the majority of the population choosing to get vaccinated.

I obviously don't know the hard numbers, but I'd guess that without a passport or some sort of incentivizing, the US would see maybe 70-75% of it's adult population getting it. The idea of a passport could convince another 15-20% to get it, because they want to attend private events and dine in at restaurants again. In which case it could've been the difference between achieving herd immunity or not.

Measles requires 93-95% of the population to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Are you really sure we'd get to that level without a passport with how politicized Covid has become and with how much misinformation is out there?

The pork thing with certain religions is a concern - but there will be enough alternate options. And there are those with medical conditions that literally shouldn't be getting vaccines of any type - which makes it doubly important that normal, healthy adults get it to help form the vaccinated part of the herd.

In the end, I just feel like there is a decent chunk of americans who have forgotten what are their rights vs what are their priveleges.

I had a coworker get reinfected about 100 days after her first infection, and unfortunately she had it bad both times. I assume she got one of the variants the second time. I don't know why the vaccine protects you longer but that seems to be what all the studies are showing. Sorry you got sick!

Why?


There's no money in it.  If they would come out and say that infected people should have 6 months of protection, how many of them are going to get a jab?  It would slow the vaccination process and cause many people who haven't been infected to say they won't get the vaccination and will wait for their own natural immunity to kick in after they get covid.  

This doesn't mean the vaccine is evil or scientist are evil for pushing vaccines.  It's a good way to prevent variants (which are largely overblown by the media) and also a good way to get out of the pandemic faster.

gtc1v6l,2021-04-03,"Biologist and medical professional here. I can give you a hypothesis why when you get covid the amount of antibodies produced is less than the vaccine.   


COVID is looking for cells with ACE2 receptors, think of this receptor as a locked door. COVID as the key. COVID can infect a large variety of cell types, not just lung epithelial layers, but some immune cells. This is what causes majority of the damage. By infecting immune cells that direct the immune system, they cause the immune system to attack healthy cells by accident. The mechanism being a feedback loop. Instead of a car with a brake peddle and a gas peddle, it now has two gas peddles and you want it to stop.  


I believe it is this confusion within the immune system that causes a less robust immune response. The vaccination process doesn't have the ""confusion"" step, and antibody production should move along without interference. From the phase 1 and 2 pfizer studies I have read, the antibody product is about 5 fold high.  


Possible ways to test hypothesis. Artificially induce the same feedback loop in a mouse model. Inflammation and signaling cascade. Vaccinate one group of mice with feedback loop. Compare to control mice. You could also get mice sick with COVID and compare to artificial induced feedback loop mice.  


It could also be that the vaccine is just that much better at producing an immune response from a mechanical standpoint. But that is a different explaining, also hypothetical.

Covid19 is a corona virus like the flu.  The flu mutates enough each year that your existing flu reaction antibodies (which would protect you from the same strain) are unlikely to protect you from the new strain.

It's likely that the covid-19 innoculations will be similar to the pattern of flu vaccines, but of course protecting you from something much more dangerous than flu (which is already pretty dangerous).

The engineered vaccine selects components of the ""spike protein"" which is part of how the virus infects cells, the idea being that if there is a mutation here the virus is likely less able to infect.  It may still mutate and still be able to infect cells however.  Your body might happen to fight a ""real"" covid-19 infection by attacking unrelated surface proteins that are more likely to mutate without damaging the ability of the virus to infect.

To a degree I agree with you. But at the same time, when children are being indoctrinated in Marxist idiocy, and those who protest are jailed and taken through the court and prosecutorial system for speaking up (a punishment in and of itself) , it's not just up to us. Those children then grow up and can no longer thing critically or self-inspect, and they become a major barrier to fixing the system - the people who claim to be the Resistance but are parroting the same stuff major corporations and government are saying? At this point it's not just up to us. There needs to be a cleaning house and a righting for those people who have been lied to - then once they have their eyes open, they can make their own, informed choice.

I just want consistency in these things. I hate inconsistency - this is where injustice comes from.

If you've never said/agreed with that, then I'd be interested in talking to you further on this subject. I don't know if you ever have, so I can't judge you there. But, I agree completely in your statement - let it cut both ways - otherwise we walk in injustice and are a disservice to our fellow humans.

> The reason the FDA exists is due to people being willing to harm others.

No, I don't recall reading that. It's more due to the fact that people were _ignorantly_ harming people, and we needed to make sure there was some level of verification of claims made and basic safety. There was a point in history where lead paint was standard, and lead face cream was standard, and accepted in society.

A side benefit of it is that malicious actors are likely to be caught as well. On the whole a good thing, IMHO. Not authorized in the Constitution for the Federal Government as a Power, though - however, I believe it should be and should be done so through an Amendment.

> This same reasoning, needing to protect the public, could be extended to the necessity of vaccinations in that by choosing not to get one you may cost the life of those unable to receive one, whether it be due to age, illness, or allergy.

This is where you've lost me. I understand the premise - the basic concept is, ""Wilfully cause someone to be injured, then you should be held responsible"". Then, ""wilfully spreading a virus is a wilful act of negligence"" like you're a kind of bioterrorist - not like someone who makes a bioweapon and knowingly unleashes it on humanity, but to a lesser degree. 

Am I right?

I pose this against other principles, namely:
1) You are responsible for your own safety and security as much as is possible. 
2) No human right stands alone as supreme, and must be balanced against other human rights. 

I'll give you an extreme example of why the principle in your argument isn't sustainable as I believe I've understood it.  When a police officer knows he has a child predator sitting in the interrogation room, but doesn't have enough evidence, he has to let them go - he isn't allowed to beat/kill/torture said person. . Even though that officer knows for a fact this person is going to go out and abuse a child soon, he has to let him go.

It is a wilful act of that officer not to kill that person on the spot. The argument above would require that the officer be held responsible for the crimes of the individual the officer let go.

""But"" , you say, ""that officer must follow the law, and he's not allowed legally to cause harm or hold that person without evidence."" Exactly right - because we must balance these rights. 

The right to not be actually wilfully harmed must be balanced against other human rights. For example, freedom of speech. Freedom of assembly. Freedom of the press. 

When someone perceives harm because of an article published citing verified facts against them, the paper willingly published something harmful to that individual. Can I then take my revenge on said paper for violating my right? No, because these rights balance each other, and the information published is factual.

So, now we return to your argument (as much as I can formulate it from your statement). 

1) I am not free from harm or perceived harm due to my human rights, but only actual harm.
2) Harm must not be due to my own negligence (if I sit in the middle of a highway and night, and get run over, it's my own fault, not the fault of the drive who couldn't see me)
3) Harm must have been reasonably avoidable while not impinging on other human rights. 
4) Restriction of rights must be as narrow as possible, when it must be done (SCotUS rulings on that effect are available).
5) Redress on harm must be taken via the courts against specifically responsible individuals. 
6) Safety is not guaranteed for anyone, it is not a human right. This is provable by the constant court rulings that police have no specific duty of care for the public, only a general one. Therefore, you cannot assume safety is a human right - it's a nice to have, but unsafety is just a fact of life. 

So the argument that anyone not wearing mask - as I understand it from you, fails on all 6 counts. If it stood as the only right, sure, I could see it, but given all that is lined up against it, it doesn't stand alone, it overruns other human rights, it's not specific to those infected, it's gone from 2 weeks to over a year, the application of rules and fines applies to those who are tested as uninfected, and there is a vaccine available, so anyone who wants to be protected now has their own culpability in not fighting to obtain the vaccine - so if they get sick, it's now on them. 

If you want to really go whole hog on this, that means every carrier who is ever traced down with a spreadable disease should be forced to pay everyone who can be proved to be infected damages. If hate to see that tried with the flu or the common cold.",1,0.088,0.138,0.774,-0.9975

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday announced that he has issued an executive order prohibiting state agencies or political subdivisions in Texas from creating “vaccine passport” requirements.

The order prohibits organizations that receive public funds from requiring consumers to provide documentation of vaccine status in order to receive any service or enter any place.

“Everyday, Texans are returning to normal life as more people get the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. But, as I’ve said all along, these vaccines are always voluntary and never forced,” said Governor Abbott in a press release. “Government should not require any Texan to show proof of vaccination and reveal private health information just to go about their daily lives. That is why I have issued an Executive Order that prohibits government-mandated vaccine passports in Texas. We will continue to vaccinate more Texans and protect public health — and we will do so without treading on Texans’ personal freedoms.”

The announcement follows the state of Florida who also did the same thing last week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the passports infringed on personal freedom and privacy concerns.”

For everyone commenting that private businesses should be allowed to do what they want - read the two paragraphs above. This order doesn’t affect private businesses that don’t take state funding. You comparing this to the government requiring private businesses bake a custom LGBT wedding cake is wrong and misinformed.


Edit: The order also explains why this is different from other vaccines since so many people have brought up the fact that schools require vaccination (never mind the fact that showing vaccination records one is not equivalent to showing medical record every time you buy groceries).


The COVID-19 vaccine is approved for emergency use by the FDA. Federal law doesn’t require individuals to use products that only emergency use authorization. The order itself actually states all this. But that’s why a Covid vaccine isn’t the same as a polio vaccine requirement for schools.
And before people say this is unnecessary bc federal law covers it, keep in mind that 1) NY has a vaccine pass in progress and 2) LA is requiring children to get the vaccine before they go back to school.

People living with vaccinated NHS staff in Scotland were considerably less likely to catch the virus than those living with unvaccinated health workers, providing direct evidence the jab can protect others.


And a separate analysis of the test results of hospital workers in Cambridge found a 75% decrease in asymptomatic infections after vaccination.


In Israel, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appeared to reduce all infections by as much as 90%, although the Ministry of Health could not be certain of the precise number as not everyone came forward for asymptomatic testing.


And, a different Israeli study found, the infections there had much lower ""viral loads"" - people shed less virus, meaning they would be less contagious as well as at lower risk of becoming ill. “

Um, I'm not in medical school. I'm flattered, I guess? I'm just using common sense here.

When I say ""high-risk,"" I'm saying, people who could have serious complications from getting the disease. When I say ""low-risk."" I'm saying, people who won't have serious complications from getting the disease. We should prioritize the high-risk people getting vaccines because they are the ones that need it the most. If low-risk people want to get it too, then great, but if they don't, it's not the end of the world, because the high-risk people already have the vaccine and are protected anyway. This is just common sense.

gtnfs1d,2021-04-06,"Hi,I am not quite sure how the influenza connects with what you are trying to say. Anywhere from 290,000 to 650,000 people die a year (globally) from the flu. In the United States that ranges from 12,000 to 61,000 deaths per year. In the year 2019-2020, 22,000 people died from the influenza in America. Source below.

During 2020-2021 year, 3,187,086 died from covid-19 (globally) and 350,000 in the United States (reported Jan 6th).

The influenzas death rate globally is only \~20% of Covid's (650,000/3,187,086) and \~17.43% of America's death rate (61,000/350,000). Notice these were using the highest value. Using 2019's influenza comparative to 2020's covid the influenza makes up only \~6.29% of Covid's deaths (USA). Covid kills roughly 16 times as much as people as influenza does. I assume these numbers vary so much because the CDC recommends influenza vaccines once a year. In some enterprises and industries it is mandatory. Yes, this causes problems for people who cannot take vaccines due to disabilities or diseases.

What any of this has to do with free will and autonomy?—I am not sure. But I'll bite.

My assumption is that you are trying to say some people's deaths are warranted so that you may retain free will and autonomy. I understand that—you want to be a self-governing agent. But who is to say that governing yourself gives you the most set of options available to you now or in the future. You could, for example, catch Covid and die. Not very much self governance then. There is also no guarantee that you will have the opportunities that you wants to have most. Besides, you may also govern yourself without appreciating a difference between right and wrong. You can do something wrong, not know the performed action is wrong, and still not be blamed for that wrong under the umbrella of self-governance.

To claim that autonomy and free will are necessary conditions is to reject political and legal authority of those that view otherwise (i.e. validity of a vaccine passport). Those that view otherwise have an illegitimate power.

To have autonomy, you have to be able to do things, essentially to choose to not take the vaccine. You have to also initiate your own actions. In this case, mentally choosing to not take the vaccine. You have now used your own autonomy. As long as you are the one who chooses to not take the vaccine, your thoughts about your own commitments and judgements to not take the vaccine are the authority. They are yours after all. Now you log into Reddit. You bristle your quills. You are ready to protest the authority of a vaccination passport. But now you are interacting in a group, a collective, a society. Your protests are an affront to the autonomy to the one you wish to admonish. Further, whatever authority you protest has now moved you into action. Your have been swept away by your choice in agency.

And you didn't even have to die from Covid-19 this time to lose it. You already have.

As for your second paragraph, I am not even sure who you are talking to there, but it was not a response to me. Try again.

Finally—and perhaps most importantly—since you have not read Benjamin Franklin, let me educate you. You start with not quoting the proper quote. I will paste it here for your convenience.

""Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" -Benjamin Franklin, from a letter

Now, why this butchering is so important is because of the context of the quotation:

Benjamin Franklin wrote about a tax dispute between Pennsylvania General Assembly & the Penn family (this is the family that ruled Pennsylvania from afar). Legislature tried taxing the Penn's lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. The Penn family instructed the governor to veto this tax. Now, Benjamin Franklin felt this stopped the legislature from effectively governing. He literally meant purchase temporary safety. The Penn family tried to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.

To reiterate, Benjamin Franklin literally meant you should get the vaccine, so the government can effectively continue to function and so you (and the collective society) may retain your autonomy in the future.

Now I would love to talk further with you if you want to discuss anything I have mentioned in this post.

And before you say “if they’re at that high of a risk then why don’t they get the vaccine themself?” the answer to that question, as is also true when it comes to the COVID vaccine, is that there are people who are immunocompromised so badly that they aren’t able to get the vaccine for risk to themselves, and because young children (less than 6 months old) also are not able to receive the vaccine as their immune system isn’t developed enough.

So, if you ever end up having a child, or if you already do, look that child in the eye and imagine them at 4 months old, coughing so badly they have to hospitalized, with oxygen through their nose because they need extra due to their lungs being inflamed.

The willingness of fearful people to accept a reduction or outright violation of their rights, in order to feel secure, is what got us the patriot act.

The point about influenza, which you obviously missed while trying to accrue statistics that have nothing at all to do with the point, is that life is risk. There is no guaranteed security and any sense that such exists is simply an illusion.

People die. That’s life. A 99% survival rate is pretty good for a disease that was billed as the next Black Death. I’m healthy and have a good immune system. On the other hand, some people have had issues with the vaccine, some very serious issues, and it’s untried. There has been some conjecture that the immunity from the vaccine might only have a limited time frame, as well. 

All that being said, I’ll take my risks as I see fit. If you want to take it, then feel free to do so. It’s funny to me that people who insist abortion should be legal because a woman has a right to decide what happens to her own body, in spite of the fact that he decision might cause the death of a baby, are the same people who insist other people have no right to decide what gets injected into their bodies. I guess liberty for some but not others.

By the way, my not getting the vaccine will not keep others from doing so. Those who get the vaccine supposedly won’t be able to catch covid ( the purpose of the vaccine) and so, only those who chose to take the risk of not getting the vaccine will actually be at risk for not taking it.

I thank you and everyone in this comment thread for having a real conversation with me tho haha.

Operation Warp Speed was a collaboration that included HHS and the CDC. So the experts that are part of Warp Speed are giving the estimates out that he disagreed with. That is odd right?

> What about anyone else in the process? WaPo says ""without evidence,"" which is patently ridiculous since the administration has access to all the background information that serves as evidence.

Again, you are looking at it in a negative tone. The article goes and explains that the experts that are part of the federal government participating in Warp speed are giving one estimate spanning months, and Trump is saying April.

 ""No evidence"" means that he didn't really justify how he could derive such a precise and aggressive timeline for hundreds of millions of doses 7 months in advance for vaccines that weren't even approved yet. The evidence they are looking for is why his numbers are more valid than the scientific community which would have done most of the legwork on deriving a timeline.

gtv6hq3,2021-04-07,"No, because before now businesses and institutions didn't care about the flu. They now have certain guidelines they have to comply with (e.g. a certain number of employees testing positive= you have to shut down for two weeks), so it makes sense they'd want to take steps to minimize the likelihood of that happening. In states where those guidelines don't exist, there is still a lot of social/economic pressure for businesses to verify vaccine status of their patrons (e.g. other people may be more likely to go there if passports are required). 

The bottom line is that there's plenty of legal precedent for private businesses to have any requirements of entry they want. They're allowed to require certain clothes or styles of dress, that their patrons be of a certain age, or that everyone have a tattoo of a money on their buttcheek. The only thing they can't do is discriminate against a protected class. At the federal level, these are currently defined as race, color, country of origin, religion, sex/orientation, disability, and family status. Personal ethics/politics/preferences about vaccines is not a protected class. 

Some people may try to argue a ""religious"" opposition to vaccines, but in reality there are no organized religious groups that don't allow them. I know that religion is personal to everyone, but it would be very hard to prove legally that a preference for not being vaccinated is due to your religion. And there is already pecedent for vaccination status not being tied to religion in this way, as several states do not have religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for school entry (meaning kids can be turned away from public schools if their families choose not to vaccinate). 

As for the disability class, it is possible that some people's inability to be vaccinated is due to a physical disability or medical condition. There are already discussions being had about how to exempt those individuals from the passport. The reality is though, for that small group of medically fragile people, they are likely not interacting with the public any time soon, regardless of passports.

For the remaining individuals who don’t have a drivers license, we can make it so the government makes it very easy for all citizens to obtain an ID. This should be an easy initiative.

People have valid concerns for not taking the vaccine (religious, medical, etc.) I struggle to come up with a reasonable objection to having a photo ID.

gu0h3qk,2021-04-09,">my understanding of the mRNA vaccines is that it essentially rewrites a small piece of your genes

Incorrect.  
In your cells, you have DNA. That DNA has sections which code for proteins. You cells translate a section of DNA into something called mRNA, and that mRNA molecule moves to something called the Ribosomes in your cell. Those ribosomes translate the mRNA into a protein, which is then used by the cell to do certain things, ie: break down alcohol in your liver. That mRNA is very unstable and breaks down pretty fast, which adds a point of control for the cell to stop translation of a gene by simply stopping the reading of that piece of DNA into mRNA.

Pfizer vaccine contains just a piece of mRNA, which as said above, is very unstable. It exists for long enough to create some of the viral protein for your body to react to, and then breaks down, without a trace. It does not 'modify' or 'rewrite' your genes - your genes are DNA, the vaccine is mRNA, which is read, and then breaks down.

You can go backwards, ie: RNA to DNA, however you need the presence of an enzyme called 'reverse transcriptase', which is present in viruses called retroviruses (like HIV) - human DNA doesn't code for that enzyme, so it can't convert it back to DNA. It's just read by your cell, and that's it.

Two deaths out of nearly 8 million doses is a perfectly acceptable standard of safety. No vaccine is 100% safe. There will always be people who will have reactions, whose specific circumstances are impossible to predict in laboratory tests.

The FDA wrote this in a pamphlet from 2011 on vaccine safety:

""If a link is found between a possible side effect and a vaccine, public health officials take appropriate action by first weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change."" ([https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines,%20blood%20&%20biologics/published/Ensuring-the-Safety-of-Vaccines-in-the-United-States.pdf](https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines,%20blood%20&%20biologics/published/Ensuring-the-Safety-of-Vaccines-in-the-United-States.pdf))

Because of the J&J vaccine, 8 million people are now protected from the COVID virus. A few deaths from reactions are acceptable. The likelihood of you personally having a reaction is less than one in a million.

A lot of conservatives need to get their heads out of their asses. The vaccine was not developed by the government. It was developed by private companies with financial support from the feds.

Prior, the vaccine became available in tiers.  It started with elderly and dropped in age every month or so.

>They are the only people at risk, at least at greater risk than the risk of shark attack death.

This isn't true or at the least is misleading.  If you are comparing the mortality rate of a single individual it can be seen as correct.  But there is more to the picture.  Firstly it's true that a single healthy person can easily survive the virus.  However that same person is more likely to not have symptoms or have mild symptoms because they are healthy which makes them more likely to go on to infect other people who cannot survive the virus.

The only way to track mutations is by doing a genome sequencing.... which is not part of the normal COVID test. We don’t have a clear picture of how many COVID variants are out there any how effective the vaccines will be against all of them.

Many vaccines have multiple doses but 2 for COVID-19 are already being talked about as not enough. Everyone was told two and done for the mRNA ones. Where in the EUA does it talk about multiple boosters? It sounds like they haven’t finished the research on this vaccine.

No vaccine prevents infection, full stop. Vaccines help your body fight off infections to lessen symptoms. Look up “how vaccines work” 

CDC says we still need masks. I agree it’s because they are LYING because they don’t trust the public. Let that sink in. I would add that IMO it’s because they know their budget will be slashed again once this “pandemic” is over. 

Safe and effective.... Maybe depends on your risk. In my age bracket and physical health I have between a 40-80% chance of being asymptomatic but an 80% chance the second shot of moderna vaccine will give me covid symptoms. Also one of the reasons mRNA vaccines have not been approved in the past is due to them causing vaccine enhanced disease (VED) in animal studies. Look up page 48 of the phfizer EUA “no available data” so they literally got a pass with their biggest hurdle. 

Finally I would recommend you look at the CDC mortality data. The updated average comorbidities for those who died from the coronavirus is 4. Trying to blame anyone’s COVID-19 transmission for them being hospitalized is disconnected from reality.

>Up until 2020, these mRNA biotech companies had poor results testing mRNA drugs for cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases; selected targets for cancer; and rare diseases like Crigler–Najjar syndrome, with most finding that the side-effects of the mRNA delivery methods were too serious. mRNA vaccines for human use have been developed and tested for the diseases rabies, Zika, cytomegalovirus, and influenza, although these mRNA vaccines have not been licensed. Many large pharmaceutical companies abandoned the technology, while some biotechs re-focused on the less profitable area of vaccines, where the doses would be at lower levels and side-effects reduced.

>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, no mRNA drug or vaccine had been licensed for use in humans. In December 2020, both Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech obtained emergency use authorization for their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which had been funded by Operation Warp Speed (directly in the case of Moderna and indirectly for Pfizer–BioNTech).

>Before 2020, no mRNA technology platform (drug or vaccine) had been authorized for use in humans, so there was a risk of unknown effects. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic required faster production capability of mRNA vaccines, made them attractive to national health organisations, and led to debate about the type of initial authorization mRNA vaccines should get (including emergency use authorization or expanded access authorization) after the eight-week period of post-final human trials.",-2,0.032,0.104,0.863,-0.9402

So people who can be vaccinated and choose to not be are an extra risk to those employees or customers, albeit not necessarily a huge one.

gvoyd9d,2021-04-24,">People shouldn't be forced to take any vaccine. Period. If they want to get polio, chicken pox, or any other preventable diseases just because they refuse to take vaccine, I would say let them.

Protecting *you* is only part of any of your vaccines' job.  Perhaps a bigger reason that schools might require a polio vaccine is because they don't want a polio outbreak at the school.  Vaccines are not 100% effective, but they are effective enough to create herd immunity—those who are not immune cannot get the disease because there's nowhere to get it from.  If enough people don't get the vaccine, then there is no longer herd immunity and there are enough potential vectors to cause an outbreak, which could even affect some people who are vaccinated but simply didn't develop the expected immunities.  So you're putting more than just yourself in danger when you don't get a vaccine.  Furthermore, even if it was just about you, you'd create an increased strain on the healthcare system if you got a disease that could have been prevented by a vaccine.  That societal cost is similar to the justification for seat-belt laws, even though you're not really jeopardizing anyone but yourself when you don't wear one.

Right now, I don't believe anyone is required to get any vaccine.  In some cases, that means that you can't go to public schools, but there are numerous exceptions and lots of people who game the system.  And there's a pretty huge societal cost because of it, both in terms of lost productivity and a more strained healthcare system (and, of course, the largest cost is people who die because of a generally preventable disease, which can't be quantified like other more purely economic factors).  In theory, we could eliminate that cost by requiring proof of vaccination before you enter public facilities or privately-owned businesses, and refusing to offer medical care to the unvaccinated.  But in general, people don't like to let people die when society can help it, even if the death is caused by irresponsibility (especially when the victim is a child subject to parental irresponsibility).  Plus, to actually distribute vaccine proofs to everyone and then deploy people literally everywhere to check them and prevent forgeries would be an incredible effort.  And if it was ever pulled off, then non-vaccinated people would throw a fit that we're not *really* respecting their right to not get a vaccine since the consequences are so absurd.  So society reluctantly accepts the cost of the non-vaccinated, because the cost to feasibly *not* accept it is even higher.

But you can see, I think, how people refusing to get vaccines is unideal.  Of course, it's not *as* serious with the COVID vaccine as with polio or something, because polio is far more dangerous, and ideally with the vaccines, COVID's increased contagiousness will become a non-factor (but COVID is still a very dangerous disease especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, and anyone who isn't willing to take simple measures to prevent it is selfish beyond belief).  But anyway, with virtually every individual liberty, there's a societal cost of your choosing to exercise it (for example, free expression can and does lead to the promotion of destructive ideologies, a cost we accept because the benefits of free individual expression are so important).  We always have to balance between not restricting individual liberties, and not allowing people to create too high a societal cost to accept.  Not getting the COVID vaccine is an individual choice (although I am baffled by conservatives who believe that a business should be *forced* to serve and/or employ people without vaccines, which flies in the face of the libertarian economics in which we generally believe), but it's a matter of opinion whether or not you're willing to accept the societal cost it creates to protect that choice.  My personal opinion is that everyone should get the vaccine but should not be forced to, private businesses should be allowed to request proof should they so choose and have every right to fire employees who do not get it, and public entities should wait for the vaccine to get full FDA approval before requiring it for places like schools, though I can certainly respect those who want to require it now given the vaccines' extremely promising record of safety and effectiveness.",3,0.138,0.105,0.757,0.9695

Also, I think you are getting a little bit mixed up on how mRNA vaccines work.  Here is info directly from the CDC:

 

1. **First**, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the immune cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.
2. **Next**, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19.
3. **At the end of the process**, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.

There is little to no evidence that getting the vaccine will be a net benefit in the long term. Simply due to the nature of medical research, it will take years to determine if the vaccine is more of a net benefit than getting COVID and recovering.

That said, if you as a low risk individual are interacting with anyone who is at risk, it's a no brainer. I rushed and got the vaccine when it was available to me because my parents are not only at risk due to their age, but due to complicating medical conditions. My parents intentionally did not visit for the holidays in 2020 for this reason alone. If I get (and I suspect I had it, long story) COVID, I would be in for an unpleasant couple weeks. If my mom or dad got COVID it would be damn near a death sentence due to their chronic health issues.

I want to make this incredibly clear, it is a marvel of modern science/engineering that we even have a vaccine. From the studies I have read I am convinced all iterations are reasonably safe. If it were not for my parents I'd have probably skipped the vaccine simply because I know that contracting COVID would be low risk for me, and we have no definitive proof of the long term safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells.

1. **First**, the vector (**not** the virus that causes COVID-19, but a different, harmless virus) will enter a cell in our body and then use the cell’s machinery to produce **a harmless** piece of the virus that causes COVID-19. This piece is known as a spike protein and it is only found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.
2. **Next**, the cell displays the spike protein on its surface, and our immune system recognizes it doesn’t belong there. This triggers our immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection.
3. **At the end of the process**, our bodies have learned how to protect us against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that we get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. Any temporary discomfort experienced after getting the vaccine is a natural part of the process and an indication that the vaccine is working.

That's something you can easily look up with the data we have broken down by cohorts on both vaccination and infection. Both are exceptionally rare for younger cohorts based on all available data, but vaccination still provides a better safety profile. 

Let's say for simplicity's sake that 1 in 1 million people have some kind of adverse vaccine reaction, and 10 in 1 million people have an adverse coronavirus infection. Let's say 0 in 1 million people die from vaccination under the age of 25, and 3 in 1 million die under the age of 25. In both cases, adverse events and death are very rare for all of the above groups, but the vaccinated group still did much better.

We also don't know what the long-term effects are from having COVID-19, so the logic doesn't follow. We know that you're way better off in the short-term with vaccination compared to infection, and for the long-term we have two unknowns. So which long-term unknown would you rather pick?

gw6ak6x,2021-04-27,"Variants just means that there are genotypically different strains of the virus. Genotypes don't matter as much as phenotypes. Your immune system trains itself to recognize parts of the virus presented as epitopes on antigen-presenting cells. If these antigens aren't phenotypically different, then there is no difference to your immune system even if they come from a genotypically different strain. That phenotypic homogeneity seems to be what the data are bearing out regarding the genotypic variants and is why the vaccines are still effective against these variants; they have conserved epitopes that are common between the variant strains that are all recognized by your immune system. This is the reason why we've had such exceedingly few breakthrough infections despite the existence of these genotypic variants.

>And even then, the vaccine created does not provide 100% protection (pfizer has 95% efficacy, astrazeneca has 80% efficacy) from the original covid variant.

That sounds like an incredibly effective vaccine. Hell, you're even talking to a measles vaccine non-responder. I've had 3 MMR vaccines in the last 4 years yet I can't seroconvert IgG for measles. I asked my immunology professor about this, and she said that it's not that uncommon for people to show an insufficient measles titer after vaccination, especially younger adult males (I'm a 31-year-old man). My classmate from medical school can't seroconvert mumps. These anecdotes are represented by the data as well, so it's not like I'm just giving you a couple of stories and telling you that it's the science. An anecdote is a datum, and the data also back what I'm saying. 

As someone who may not be immune to measles (I may make an undetectable level of antibodies, and I may have a sufficient t-cell response, which can't be measured by an antibody titer), I wouldn't expect you to mask up for measles even if there was a measles outbreak (we still have a few dozen cases of measles every year) even though it could kill me. If you're afraid of me not wearing a mask, then stay home.

> So it is better to err on the safe side and suggest people to still wear mask until new studies to prove that the vaccine works for the new variants as well.

The link above and several other studies demonstrate that the vaccine is effective against variants for the reason I described above: they share the same or similar spike antigens, which are recognized by both antibodies and t-cell responses from vaccination.

You could say that it's still safer to wear the mask, but that's true of all other viruses with a respiratory transmission like influenza or measles. I don't see a real reason why we should mask up after vaccination for this particular coronavirus when we don't even mask up for those. After vaccination, you have an exceptionally miniscule chance of developing a COVID-19 state after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and your chance of transmission is very unlikely. If you still want to follow this logic of saying that it's safer to continue masking, then I don't really see a point where you say that we can stop masking. Even if transmission of the coronavirus approaches zero, as people become vaccinated, their chances of developing a severe disease state or dying after infection plummets below that of things like influenza, so why not mask up for the flu?",0,0.085,0.042,0.873,0.963
gw6r5q3,2021-04-27,"The mRNA technology isn’t actually brand new, but a few years old. This is its first application to vaccines that has been produced and put to market, but they’ve adapted the technology to vaccines in the last few years for other diseases but never went forward with massive production. The main reason is that they (I forget which companies) made vaccines for things that already had established vaccines on the market, sort of as a proof of concept, but never went any farther than that because it wouldn’t make financial sense, people would just use the old vaccine like they had been doing for years. 

In terms of side effects, we’ve seen the widely understood immune response side effects that mimic flu like symptoms (usually after the second dose) but the moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines have been given to tens bearing hundreds of millions not just in the US but world wide, and the scrutiny on their safety is extreme. We’re paying so close attention that they saw 6 cases of that blood clot out of 7 millions of doses for the J&J vaccine and were proactive enough to pause the trial to evaluate (I have my own problems with the way they messaged and handled it, probably scaring people way more than necessary). If there were any significant side effects we would know by now. As for long term side effects, you have to keep in mind that people got these vaccines almost a year ago now for the clinical trials for these vaccines. Those people don’t just disappear after the trial ends, the companies consistently check in with them to assess for  long term side effects and we have seen no negative effects in those people.

In terms of efficacy, the question of how long the  vaccines will provide immunity is still being evaluated but the mRNA vaccine cause near 100% of people who have gotten both doses to avoid even symptomatic infections. Typical vaccines are approved if they can reach even 65-70% so this is an amazing achievement in comparison. But that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to get covid after you get the vaccine. The key is to understand the purpose of these vaccines: they were not designed to prevent infection, they were designed to prevent severe covid (hospitalization and/or death). In that frame of reference they are 100% effective. No one in any of the trials who received the vaccine was hospitalized compared to many who were on placebo. The ability to almost fully prevent symptomatic  infection is actually a happy bonus. But the question of if you can not show symptoms yet transmit covid is a serious thing we need to figure out and is hard to study (since you’re not showing symptoms). That’s why mask wearing and promoting vaccination is so important, if your family is vaccinated it doesn’t mean you are totally safe (but definitely much safer)

As for mandatory vaccines, no I don’t believe you should be forced by government or anyone to get the vaccines. In terms of companies requiring vaccination for entry I think it gets murkier, because it can be seen as coercion yet it also gets into the territory of

I took the vaccine because taking it reduces the pool of people who are available to get sick. If I get Covid, I likely won’t get it hard enough that I need to be hospitalized. I follow public health closely, and the people I respect in public health believe that the vaccine is safe. Given the numbers of people who’ve been vaccinated, I believe it is safe. When my kids are eligible, I will have them vaccinated, too.

I think the realm of public health is difficult. When it’s working well, it’s really out of sight. When there’s a pandemic, it’s hard to educate the population that really hasn’t paid attention to it before, and balance basic but sometimes primitive public health tools like social distancing, quarantining and isolation, with basic freedoms.

Anecdotally, that was born out through my case interviews, but that is anecdote not data. Speaking to my cases who are terribly ill, there was no question, they were ill.

If 10 in 100 people would have gotten to a COVID-19 disease state from a SARS-COV-2 infection in the absence of vaccination, but only 1 in 100 people got to a COVID-19 disease state because of vaccination, then the vaccine prevents COVID-19. The real world data are far more disparate than the simple math example I used here.

The CDC is reporting deaths after vaccination, but a death after vaccination does not mean that the vaccine caused the death. For example, if a guy goes and gets his vaccine, steps out of the clinic, and gets ran over by a car, is that a vaccine death? If a person is dying of cancer and expires 3 weeks after vaccination, is that a vaccine death? If someone is obese, smokes, and is 65 years old and dies of a heart attack 3 days after getting a shot, is that a vaccine death? I'd say no, which is why in none of the 3,848 deaths among people who received the vaccine has the vaccine been implicated in the cause of death.

If your employees are vaccinated and are still wearing masks/social distancing what level of threat do you think someone who is not vaccinated poses to their health?


I won't assume your employees ability to get the vaccine but to further my thought let's say they are. I am not asking for their specific situations. 

I'm not sure about the 52 year old but I know that those with asthma are encouraged to get the vaccine per the cdc. Right now the only people not recommended to get it are those with an known allergic reaction to the ingredients. Those who are immunocompromised may not get full protection but it also won't hurt them. 


What is your time line for requiring vaccines for customers?

I ask because in my county of 250,000 we are only getting 6000 a week. With 2 doses required it's really only 3000 people a week. It's even less than that because we get people from out of county here as well. Quick math puts that at over 80 weeks. That's not accounting for children who won't get it and the ramp up of production that will shorten that time. but easily 9 months or even a year. At this point people may need to start getting boosters.

The human body Contains about 2 million different proteins we don't know how this vaccine is going to interact with them, we haven't even mapped them all.  One of the theories about the blood clots associated with the J&J vaccine is that the modified Spike protein they used is similar to platelet factor 4 and is causing an autoimmune response on platelets. 

These MRNA vaccines are a new class of medicine and we cannot know the long term effects they have.  This is why there is usually such a long development cycle for new medications,  it's also why they never (before this) test experimental drugs on pregnant women and children.

People are allowed to criticize poor decisions. The decisions you make affect other people. In this case it could potentially kill someone.

FFS, the regulations that came about because of the Thalidomide disaster is the reason why your claims about being hesitant are not credible.

Part of the reason for why the average time of bringing a drug to market is so long is due to small number of volunteers.  2020 had a very high level of interest and by a large number of people to get the vaccine and due to the large global cooperation surrounding the data means they could move much faster through the clinical trials.

Well not exactly.  That's a privacy violation (just like a private business that requires a proof of vaccine shouldn't be able to access your medical records without your consent—but they can fire you for not consenting because even though you have no obligation to consent, you don't have the right to a job with them so they can fire you for any reason or no reason at all).  But a private Christian university should have every right to *ask* for medical records, and refuse admission to any woman who refuses to provide them or whose records show that they have had an abortion.  Likewise, a private university could do the opposite and exclusively serve women who have had abortions, if that's what they wanted to do for some reason.  I, personally, would not endorse the actions of either university, but their university is not my property, nor is it the government's property, meaning that it is not up to either of us to whom the university chooses to offer its service.

I am not saying that a private business should be allowed to access private medical records, but they can ask and refuse to serve people who refuse to provide.  You're under no obligation to compromise your privacy and reveal them, in that your rights are protected whether you do or don't, but you never had the right to their service/employment in the first place.

>They are mandating a vaccine that’s not approved yet. And they’re mandating it in an age group that is largely unaffected by this virus.

They can mandate whatever they feel like.  The education that they provide is their property that they are choosing to exchange for money.  Unless you signed a contract that obligated them to continue to provide that education over a longer term without any escape clause that they can exercise in this circumstance, then they can decide to opt out of that exchange whenever they want.  It could be because you're not getting a vaccine and they feel you should, or it could be because they don't like your new hair color or your voice is too high-pitched for them or whatever arbitrary criteria they decide.  You can feel free to find another university that *will* give you an education without requirements you feel are arbitrary and unjustifiable.

This is not accurate. This is just the number of cases that are absolutely confirmed to be linked with the vaccine despite all the attempts to make them unrelated.

It is pretty clear to me that there's a huge bias to not link deaths with the vaccine to not discourage vaccination. We can't trust the media those days. They didn't stop the J&J vaccine because of 2 per million: I remember a data scientist in the news very briefly mentioning ""potentially 1 in 100k"".

Also not accurate. This is again media propaganda. There's as many medical bodies encouraging vaccine as discouraging it. Just go talk to a few doctors in PRIVATE. Obviously most of those doctors don't want to go to the media for all the bad press. Criticizing the vaccine in public right now is really bad for any doctor. Cancel culture will crush anyone that does it.

Vaccination in the US is at 45% and it's slowing down drastically. Do you think half of the US doesn't want to take the vaccine solely because they are dumb? When half the population believes on something, you should always question if there isn't any truth on that.

It is publicly available, I've given multiple shots of J&J to people just this week. The FDA told everyone to hold off and let them look at the adverse vaccine side effects of it and when they analyzed the data they gave the nod of approval to give it out again. Basically they were overly cautious.

>How long does it usually take to make a vaccine? I was under the impression 5-10 years for full FDA approval. Is this an indication of a new method of rapid development? Will all new vaccines and medications now be developed and approved within a year? 

Nothing about the vaccine *trials* were rushed. Same number of trials, same length, and same number of participants as any other vaccine looking for approval. To be honest the time is so long normally because of government incompetence (surprise surprise). Normally a trial happens, they give the data to the FDA, a committee that meets every couple of months comes together to eventually look at it before it can go to the next trial. Often times these companies will also go and look for investors/funders for the next trial, which also takes time. Operation Warpspeed basically just provided funding (directly or guaranteed purchase of finalized product) and made the FDA available at all times to quickly process the data and make it move on to the next trial. I don't think new vaccines will be approved as quickly unless they're for a more serious illness. I have no idea though, honestly I think the FDA should be severely diminished and made more streamline.

It's a sensationalist headline that is leading the reader to assume something that is not true. Which is the issue.

The person that wrote this headline wrote it with the intention that people would assume that there are employees under fauci that are proactively against the vaccine which causes doubt. Because if people within his team are opposed to it, then there must be something wrong with it that they are not sharing.

The only reason your answer might stand on ""logic"" is because you are defining ""refusal"" differently than most people would interpret it in this context. Sure, you can argue that someone not proactively getting the vaccine is a ""refusal"", but the way I would define refusal in this instance is someone proactively not getting a vaccine. 

For example, imagine if they had a mobile vaccine cart that literally drove up to someone and all they had to do was spend the two seconds getting the shot in their arm and no other work was required. You have person A who says yes, I was procrastinating and hadn't gotten around to it yet, I will get the vaccine. Then you have person B who says no, I don't want the vaccine (whether its because they are hesitant, or full blown anti vax).

Leading up to the mobile vaccine cart showing up, your logic viewed both person A and B as refusing to get vaccinated. My view was that person A was never refusing it even though it was available to them, they just procrastinated and hadn't taken the time to do it yet but person B is refusing it. Sure, person B can change their mind down the road but the are proactively refusing it right now which is the main difference compared to person A.

But once I saw other people walking around without masks it felt normal again.

I honestly don’t think too many businesses are actually going to enforce any sort of vaccine passport or asking if you’re vaccinated, purely because our society has become so adverse to conflict that people would rather be quiet than risk a confrontation.

Is that really conclusive? The consensus is fuzzy on that at best. Incidences of people developing covid twice are vanishingly rare. That would suggest long term immunity is more common than not.

>Phase 3 trials may take six to nine months to allow early assessment of safety and efficacy, particularly if conducted in areas with a high risk of infection, but with follow-up continuing for two years or more to assess **long-term** safety and efficacy

So at minimum, phase 3 alone should take about 3 years to assess long term safety of a large sample size.  But in reality, the vaccine has been already under testing for years prior. So a smaller sample size is observed for a decade or longer for long term effects. The Covid vaccine today has still not completed the normal amount of time to assure even the *short-term* safety, yet alone the *long-term*.  When development is not rushed/accelerated, this phase typically takes twice as long, up to 6-10 years for this phase alone. After this phase, there are still multiple phases that need to be completed before the vaccine is approved and released to the public, each taking years. 


So even if you dedicate the entire workforce of the FDA and every medical scientist and doctor in the world to developing the covid vaccine, theres still one huge factor missing: The **time** needed to observe the possibility of any long term side effects.",29,0.097,0.045,0.858,0.9403

The Pfizer vaccine, also given in two doses, is expected to cost $19.50 a dose.

Each dose for Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine will cost an estimated $10, and AstraZeneca’s two-dose vaccine could be the cheapest at just $3 to $4 a dose.

Novavax’s two-dose vaccine is estimated to be $16 a dose.

But in reality, the guv'ment consists of many different people with many different opinions and most of those are just normal people with a mediocre 9-5 job that care about others just as much as you do.  

Then the vaccine issue, it's not just your government that wants people to take it, it's every government everywhere.

Yes it does as it requires customers of all stripes to meet certain preconditions before you can even attempt to do business. Segregation used to work on this logic. Don’t want to patronize a segregated establishment? Find one that won’t or make your own. 

Problem is, a lot of things end up de facto monopolies. If say Walmart requires vaccine passports, a great many locations effectively now mandate it because Walmart is the only significant business in town. You don’t have an alternative you can “vote with your wallet”. 

The same was true with segregation. 

> letting businesses run free would be the free market in action and consumers could boycott the businesses they disagree with which is also the free market in action.

My issue is that your decision is horribly selfish. Please, let me explain, because you may not realize why this is true.

The reason why the CDC eliminated the mask mandate for vaccinated people is that those who get the vaccine are highly unlikely to give the disease to someone who will die if they get it.

Previously, we knew nothing about how the disease could be spread amount vaccinated people. After all, <10% of those vaccinated get the disease at all. However, once millions of people got vaccinated, this small percent yield enough data to understand how this works. 

As it turns out, vaccinated people who get the vaccine have viral load in their sinuses that are pretty much undetectable. 

This means that vaccinated people are highly unlikely, even if they contract the disease, to pass it on to others. This means they are almost certainly not going to pass the disease to my dad, who would almost certainly die. This also means that they would not contribute to the development of new variants, that could make this shit worse.

I'm not asking you to explain why you make your decisions. You have your right and I respect that.

I only am asking for you to consider the ramifications of those decisions.  You might still decide that you want to not be inconvenienced to get the shot because you are invulnerable (not true, BTW and I can verify). 

Your decision to not take the shot because it will not hurt you, with full knowledge that this decision could kill other is selfish, by definition.

 I agree that this is not helpful and I did not mean to come across as being condescending. I went to college for over 10 years and it is hard for me to wrap my head around the studies.

There is a ton of scientific evidence that the vaccine is safe and extremely effective. Every damn scientist in the whole world who studies these things is working on this right now. Multiple papers are published everyday.

My emotional response is in part based on a conversation I had with my dad a couple of days ago. Based on his preexisting conditions, he will die if he gets this disease (90+% chance). He is in the last year's of his life, but he is otherwise happier than I've ever seen him before. He busted his ass to enjoy his ""golden years"". Yet, he is terrified of going back to normal because even though he is vaccinated, he knows there is a 1-2% chance that he could get the disease. Because of his illnesses, the vaccine is almost assuredly to hit him hard.

I question why his freedoms are less important than others, but okay. Why is it not okay for me to cast judgment on people who are making a decision, for no good reason, that threatens the life of my family?

h2uvb3y,2021-06-23,"I will concede to your point about the flu vaccine. That is my personal outlook on this situation. While the COVID vaccine is new, my opinion is that the method behind it is solid. mRNA vaccines could very well be the safest alternative in the future. It essentially just gives your body the instruction manual to defend against the pathogen rather than injecting you with the pathogen itself.

You’re right, we do not know the long term effects of the vaccine. But we know it is safe in the short term. We also do not know the long term effects of getting COVID-19. We do know the short term effects of getting it. For example, patients have developed pulmonary fibrosis which becomes a long term disease that has systemic effects on the body and quality of life. We know this from data on asbestos and coal inhalation. 

Medical students are grad students and yes, 3rd and 4th year medical students are involved in the care of all types of patients during their clinical rotations. 1st and 2nd year medical students also have exposure to patient care, but students on clinical rotations are directly involved in the care of their patient.

Whether to get the vaccine or not is a personal choice everyone has to make for themselves. My professional opinion is that the vaccine is safe and will be unlikely to have any long term negative effects. As is the overwhelming majority of the medical community and that’s why I am behind requiring it for health care employees. The safety of patients is of greatest importance. This is a personal risk (risk being used lightly, I don’t think the vaccine is risky unless you have health conditions which contraindicate it) I am willing to take.

****COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Learn more about EUAs in this videoexternal icon.

""A vaccine follows the same research process before a company applies for an emergency use authorization. The only difference is that the production phase begins at the same time the drug is being tested, so it can be distributed as soon as the FDA allows it.
********The scientific and research processes are not sacrificed during the emergency approval process, the FDA says.""*******

Study says:
>When Vaxzevria was used in younger age groups, the benefit–risk balance was no longer as favourable and even reversed in the younger age groups. For instance, using Vaxzevria in the entire adult population would avert four (95% PI: 2–7) COVID-19 deaths in the 18–29 year-olds and six (95% PI: 3–8) in the 30–39 year-olds, but it would be associated with 12 (95% PI: 7–19) and nine (95% PI: 6–14) deaths from TTS in these age groups, respectively.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he was informed by some members of the U.S. military that they would leave if the armed forces mandated a COVID-19 vaccine, coming after a report claimed Army headquarters told commanders to prepare for mandatory vaccinations in September.
“I’ve been contacted by members of our voluntary military who say they will quit if the COVID vaccine is mandated. I introduced HR 3860 to prohibit any mandatory requirement that a member of the Armed Forces receive a vaccination against COVID-19. It now has 24 sponsors,” Massie wrote on Twitter. He didn’t provide more details.

The lawmaker was referring to a report published by the Army Times over the weekend that detailed an executive order sent by the Department of the Army Headquarters that commands should be prepared to administer COVID-19 vaccines starting as early as Sept. 1. The date is contingent on when the Food and Drug Administration issues its full approval of the vaccines.

It’s not clear when the FDA will approve the vaccines, according to an agency spokesperson.
The Army Times reported it obtained the directive, HQDA EXORD 225-21, COVID-19 Steady State, which reads: “Commanders will continue COVID-19 vaccination operations and prepare for a directive to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for service members [on or around] 01 September 2021, pending full FDA licensure. Commands will be prepared to provide a backbrief on servicemember vaccination status and way ahead for completion once the vaccine is mandated.”

An EXORD is a directive issued by the president to the defense secretary to execute a military operation.

The Epoch Times has contacted the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army for comment. A U.S. Army spokesperson told the Army Times that “we do not comment on leaked documents” and added that “the vaccine continues to be voluntary.”
“If we are directed by [Department of Defense] to change our posture,” the spokesperson added, “we are prepared to do so.”

On Monday, Massie noted that his tweet was “targeted” by “science-illiterate, military hating, angry blue [checkmark]” users on Twitter. “There are no health outcomes based studies that show any benefit from the vaccine for those who have already had COVID,” he wrote.

The congressman also pointed to a Department of Defense study published in late June that found a higher number of military members who got the vaccine experienced higher than expected rates of heart inflammation.

U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force physicians found 23 cases of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation, in previously healthy men. They developed the condition within four days of getting the vaccine, the study published in JAMA Cardiology found.
It comes weeks after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel found a higher rate of heart inflammation after mRNA vaccines were administered.

I think this briefing is where this is all coming from.

""Q     The New York Times, last week, came out with a story that Mississippi was having a hard time getting folks vaccinated.  But it’s not just Mississippi; it’s a bunch of other rural states — Ohio, Oklahoma.  They’re at 34 percent vaccination rate. 
 
Even so, opening up vaccines to out-of-staters — I know we talked a little bit about before —
 
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.
 
Q    — the preliminary steps — but has the White House been in touch with these governors to see what they can do now?  Because, of course, this impacts herd immunity and the goals of the White House just to get these shots in arms.
 
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are a number of steps that we’ve taken in the recent weeks, including launching the Community Corps, which is our program to provide fact-based messages into the hands of local messengers.
 
So we’ve now — we’re now working with more than 4,000 organizations that have signed up so far across the country, including in a number of the states that you mentioned. 
 
We’re also investing $3 billion to states and community-based organizations to strengthen vaccine confidence in the highest-risk and hardest-hit communities.  And often, people think of that as just Black and brown communities, and that is not.  As you’ve noted, that is also conservative communities, white evangelicals.  It’s a range of communities around the country. 
 
What we’ve found to be most effective is to work with these local organizations — so, faith-based organizations, community health organizations, civic leaders, and others who can really get this message deeply in communities. 
 
We’ve also had a number of our members of our COVID team, from Dr. Fauci and Fran- — and Dr. Collins — participate — as an example — participate in a range of media interviews.  You know, an example is Dr. Collins participated in “The 700 Club.”  Dr. Nunez-Smith hosted a faith leaders roundtable.  We’re also looking for — we’ve run PSAs on “The Deadliest Catch.”  We’re engaged with NASCAR and Country Music TV.
 
We’re looking for a range of creative ways to get directly connected to white conservative communities.  We won’t always be the best messengers, but we’re still trying to meet people where they are but also empower local organizations.""",7,0.093,0.003,0.904,0.9895

I have a bit of a unique situation - my mom finished up chemo a month ago, had her 2 shots during her treatment and has has had a couple negative antibody tests since then. She's in Missouri where cases are starting to rise and it's hard knowing she's probably truly at risk but has few options (maybe a booster shot, we're looking into that now). She really benefits by everyone else getting vaccinated (or really benefits from low cases, though I personally think one leads to the other haha) so it's difficult to see people not wanting to get vaxxed for reasons that I feel are overblown or have more research disproving them (or at least mostly disproving).

Doctors are split on younger Americans who have recovered from the virus. The only way to determine if a young healthy person has remaining antibodies is to get tested. The risks of the vaccine may not be worth it for someone who has immunity. 

Finally, most pediatricians and scientists who are commenting publicly are recommending that children wait as long as possible before getting vaccinated. With several vaccines to choose from and new data coming in each day it only makes sense to wait as long as possible before vaccinating children according to the experts. Of course, there are some people who think everyone should get vaccinated no matter what - I think this is a mistake. We should encourage people to talk to their doctors and make an informed decision. Listening to some guy on Reddit or Dr. Fauci is a mistake.",12,0.054,0.041,0.905,0.606

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): This pervasive respiratory virus has proven resistant to vaccination. Children treated with one vaccine in the 1960s developed an enhanced form of the disease, suffering high fever, bronchopneumonia, and wheezing. Many were hospitalized and two died.  
  
“That set the field back years,” Poland said, as researchers and manufacturers “were afraid” to try again.  
  
Researchers have since tried but still not developed an RSV vaccine for public use, according to the CDC. Babies at particularly high risk for RSV are sometimes injected with an antibody to help fight off infection.  
  
Dengue fever: The Philippines halted a school-based vaccination program in 2017 after reports of complications and several deaths linked to the product, Dengvaxia. The French manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, later said the vaccine posed a risk to people without prior infection from one of the disease’s four stereotypes, actually increasing the risk that the child would contract a more severe form of the disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the vaccine last year for limited use: for children of certain ages, living in endemic areas, and previously infected with a form of the virus.",6,0.041,0.109,0.85,-0.9404

Thalidomide, while not a vaccine but a drug that was tested worldwide before being used in the U.S. It was rushed into use here with only months of FDA testing. The FDA testing lead to the use of the drug. The RSV vaccine was produced and used until they found serious side effects and stopped using it. I don't get what you mean by short term side effects. You say the RSV vaccine was a short term side effect. It was used from 1964 until 1967, the same time frame you asked for examples.

mRNA vaccines have been around and studied for 20 plus years but have never been used for any medical treatment.

Yes, dengue fever for one. The vaccine created non neutralizing antibodies. This lead to people dying of dengue fever who would have other wise lived because instead of killing the virus, it protected it. 

300 kids have died from covid since pandemic started, nearly all, if not all, were extremely obese. If your kids fall into that risk category, then we’ll you’ve made bad parenting decisions up to this point.

You don't think they've been studying the data a little more closely than they did for dengue fever (especially with dengue being primarily a third-world disease, where pharma companies were probably a lot less fussed by potential liability concerns)? You don't think nasty side effects would have showed up by now? If not now, when -- would you take the vaccine in 6-12 months from now, assuming the data continues to show that it's safe? Or in 2-3 years from now?

SARS-Cov1 and MERS affected a far smaller % of the population, and pharma companies are profit-driven enterprises. Does it seem a stretch to assume that they spent a ton more money on the CoV-2 vaccine and were thus able to develop it a lot more quickly? Or that they were able to leverage the prior work that had been done on those diseases, and on mRNA technology overall?

I'll concede that the risk of taking the vaccine is probably not 0%. But again, given that we're not the first ones in line for a shot at this point, the risk seems a lot smaller than \[risk of catching COVID\] \* \[risk that COVID will give you--or someone you care about who you  might infect, even if they're vaccinated because the vaccines aren't 100% effective--some nasty lasting effects\].

So say you got the dengue vaccine, and then as soon as immunity is established your body is making effective/ neutralizing antibodies so you’re safe. Then time passes, a few months, a year, two years. Your body doesn’t have those original antibodies, but it has the memory to make them when needed. You get exposed to dengue virus, and your body starts making antibodies again, but they’re not the same. They’re non neutralizing. Instead of killing the virus, the antibodies incubate them. You die. 

The reason why they didn’t have a sars or mers vaccine is because every previous attempt resulted in vaccine disease enhancement. And the symptoms of that can take more than a year after your body stops making the original antibodies. Read their FDA filings. They talk about VDE. They say they don’t think it will be a problem, they don’t say why. The question I have is, what’s changed?

And now Pfizer is asking for an EUA to give a booster. Why? Covid exposure is showing to have life long immunity. Why does the vaccine need a booster after just a 6 months?

The vaccines are efficacious at preventing symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death. Those are different measures and will have their own percent rates. And that information has been out there the entire time. From the day they released the efficacy data. 

This is a great explanation by the Lancet. As they recognized misunderstanding of info around vaccines isn’t helping anyone.

Also in the context of your friend: break through infection is rare (and documented.) I would count yourself as normal. You might even have a strong immune system.
